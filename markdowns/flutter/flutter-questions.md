### Q1: What is Flutter and what are its key features?

**Answer:**
Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase using the Dart programming language.

**Key Features:**
- **Single Codebase**: Write once, run anywhere (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
- **Fast Development**: Hot reload for instant code changes
- **Native Performance**: Compiled to native ARM code
- **Rich UI**: Extensive widget library with Material Design and Cupertino
- **Reactive Framework**: Declarative UI programming

**Flutter Architecture:**
```dart
// Basic Flutter app structure
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);
  final String title;

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
        elevation: 0,
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline6,
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Flutter vs Native Development:**
```dart
// Flutter advantages
class FlutterAdvantages {
  static const List<String> benefits = [
    'Single codebase for multiple platforms',
    'Fast development with hot reload',
    'Consistent UI across platforms',
    'Rich animation and gesture support',
    'Growing ecosystem and community',
    'Backed by Google',
  ];
  
  static const List<String> considerations = [
    'Larger app size compared to native',
    'Platform-specific features may require native code',
    'Learning curve for Dart language',
    'Relatively newer ecosystem',
  ];
}
```

**Flutter Widget Tree:**
```dart
// Understanding the widget tree
class WidgetTreeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Widget Tree'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Card(
                child: ListTile(
                  leading: Icon(Icons.person),
                  title: Text('User Profile'),
                  subtitle: Text('Manage your profile'),
                  trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward_ios),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {},
                child: Text('Action Button'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Q2: Explain Dart programming language features for Flutter development.

**Answer:**
State management is crucial in Flutter applications for handling data that changes over time. Flutter offers various approaches to manage state, each suitable for different scenarios.

**1. setState() - Built-in State Management:**
The simplest form of state management for local widget state.

```dart
class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}

class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;
  
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Count: $_counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**2. Provider - Recommended by Flutter Team:**
Provider is a wrapper around InheritedWidget that makes state management easier.

```dart
// Model class
class CounterModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  int _counter = 0;
  
  int get counter => _counter;
  
  void increment() {
    _counter++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void decrement() {
    _counter--;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void reset() {
    _counter = 0;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// Main app setup
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => CounterModel(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: CounterScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Consumer widget
class CounterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Provider Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Consumer<CounterModel>(
              builder: (context, counter, child) {
                return Text(
                  'Count: ${counter.counter}',
                  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
                );
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => context.read<CounterModel>().decrement(),
                  child: Text('-'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => context.read<CounterModel>().increment(),
                  child: Text('+'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => context.read<CounterModel>().reset(),
                  child: Text('Reset'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**3. BLoC (Business Logic Component) Pattern:**
BLoC separates business logic from UI using streams and events.

```dart
// Events
abstract class CounterEvent {}

class CounterIncrement extends CounterEvent {}
class CounterDecrement extends CounterEvent {}
class CounterReset extends CounterEvent {}

// States
abstract class CounterState {
  final int counter;
  CounterState(this.counter);
}

class CounterInitial extends CounterState {
  CounterInitial() : super(0);
}

class CounterUpdated extends CounterState {
  CounterUpdated(int counter) : super(counter);
}

// BLoC
class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, CounterState> {
  CounterBloc() : super(CounterInitial()) {
    on<CounterIncrement>((event, emit) {
      emit(CounterUpdated(state.counter + 1));
    });
    
    on<CounterDecrement>((event, emit) {
      emit(CounterUpdated(state.counter - 1));
    });
    
    on<CounterReset>((event, emit) {
      emit(CounterUpdated(0));
    });
  }
}

// BLoC Provider setup
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (context) => CounterBloc(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: CounterBlocScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// BLoC Consumer
class CounterBlocScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('BLoC Counter')),
      body: BlocBuilder<CounterBloc, CounterState>(
        builder: (context, state) {
          return Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(
                  'Count: ${state.counter}',
                  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20),
                Row(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
                  children: [
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: () => context.read<CounterBloc>().add(CounterDecrement()),
                      child: Text('-'),
                    ),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: () => context.read<CounterBloc>().add(CounterIncrement()),
                      child: Text('+'),
                    ),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: () => context.read<CounterBloc>().add(CounterReset()),
                      child: Text('Reset'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**4. Functional Programming Features:**
```dart
// Higher-order functions
class FunctionalExample {
  static List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
  
  static void demonstrateFunctionalFeatures() {
    // Map - transform each element
    var doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2).toList();
    print('Doubled: $doubled');
    
    // Filter - select elements that match condition
    var evenNumbers = numbers.where((n) => n % 2 == 0).toList();
    print('Even numbers: $evenNumbers');
    
    // Reduce - combine all elements into single value
    var sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
    print('Sum: $sum');
    
    // Fold - like reduce but with initial value
    var product = numbers.fold(1, (prev, element) => prev * element);
    print('Product: $product');
  }
}
```

**5. Hot Reload Support:**
Dart's compilation model enables Flutter's hot reload feature, allowing developers to see changes instantly without losing app state.

**6. AOT and JIT Compilation:**
- **JIT (Just-In-Time)**: Used during development for fast compilation and hot reload
- **AOT (Ahead-Of-Time)**: Used for production builds for optimal performance

**7. Memory Management:**
Dart uses automatic garbage collection, eliminating manual memory management concerns.

### Q3: Explain the difference between Stateless and Stateful widgets.

**Answer:**
Widgets are the building blocks of Flutter applications. There are two main types of widgets: Stateless and Stateful widgets.

**Stateless Widgets:**
Stateless widgets are immutable and their properties cannot change once created. They are rebuilt only when their parent widget changes.

**Characteristics:**
- Immutable (cannot change state)
- No internal state management
- Rebuilt only when parent changes
- More performant (less overhead)
- Suitable for static content

**Example:**
```dart
class WelcomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String userName;
  final String message;
  
  const WelcomeScreen({
    Key? key,
    required this.userName,
    required this.message,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Welcome'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'Hello, $userName!',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 24,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            Text(
              message,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Stateful Widgets:**
Stateful widgets can change their state during the widget's lifetime. They maintain mutable state and can rebuild themselves when the state changes.

**Characteristics:**
- Mutable (can change state)
- Internal state management
- Can rebuild themselves when state changes
- More overhead (state management)
- Suitable for interactive content

**Example:**
```dart
class CounterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final String title;
  final int initialValue;
  
  const CounterScreen({
    Key? key,
    required this.title,
    this.initialValue = 0,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  State<CounterScreen> createState() => _CounterScreenState();
}

class _CounterScreenState extends State<CounterScreen> {
  late int _counter;
  bool _isEven = true;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _counter = widget.initialValue;
    _updateEvenStatus();
  }
  
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
      _updateEvenStatus();
    });
  }
  
  void _decrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter--;
      _updateEvenStatus();
    });
  }
  
  void _resetCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter = widget.initialValue;
      _updateEvenStatus();
    });
  }
  
  void _updateEvenStatus() {
    _isEven = _counter % 2 == 0;
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.refresh),
            onPressed: _resetCounter,
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'Counter Value:',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineSmall,
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineLarge?.copyWith(
                color: _isEven ? Colors.green : Colors.red,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            Text(
              _isEven ? 'Even Number' : 'Odd Number',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 18,
                color: _isEven ? Colors.green : Colors.red,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 32),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
              children: [
                FloatingActionButton(
                  onPressed: _decrementCounter,
                  heroTag: 'decrement',
                  child: Icon(Icons.remove),
                ),
                FloatingActionButton(
                  onPressed: _incrementCounter,
                  heroTag: 'increment',
                  child: Icon(Icons.add),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Stateless Widget | Stateful Widget |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Mutability** | Immutable | Mutable |
| **State Management** | No internal state | Has internal state |
| **Rebuild Trigger** | Parent widget changes | setState() calls |
| **Performance** | Better (less overhead) | More overhead |
| **Use Cases** | Static content, UI components | Interactive elements, dynamic content |
| **Lifecycle** | build() only | initState(), build(), dispose(), etc. |
| **Memory Usage** | Lower | Higher |

**Stateful Widget Lifecycle Methods:**
```dart
class LifecycleExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LifecycleExampleState createState() => _LifecycleExampleState();
}

class _LifecycleExampleState extends State<LifecycleExample> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Called once when widget is inserted into widget tree
    print('initState called');
  }
  
  @override
  void didChangeDependencies() {
    super.didChangeDependencies();
    // Called when dependencies change
    print('didChangeDependencies called');
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Called every time widget needs to be rendered
    print('build called');
    return Container();
  }
  
  @override
  void didUpdateWidget(LifecycleExample oldWidget) {
    super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
    // Called when parent widget changes
    print('didUpdateWidget called');
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Called when widget is removed from widget tree
    print('dispose called');
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

**When to Use:**
- **Stateless**: Static text, icons, layouts that don't change
- **Stateful**: Forms, animations, counters, any interactive UI

### Q4: What are the different state management approaches in Flutter?

**Answer:**
State management is crucial in Flutter applications for handling data that changes over time. Flutter offers various approaches to manage state, each suitable for different scenarios.

**1. setState() - Built-in State Management:**
The simplest form of state management for local widget state.

```dart
class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}

class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;
  
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Count: $_counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**2. Object-Oriented Programming:**
```dart
// Classes and inheritance
abstract class Animal {
  String name;
  Animal(this.name);
  
  void makeSound(); // Abstract method
  
  void sleep() {
    print('$name is sleeping');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  String breed;
  
  Dog(String name, this.breed) : super(name);
  
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('$name barks!');
  }
  
  void fetch() {
    print('$name is fetching the ball');
  }
}

// Mixins for code reuse
mixin Flyable {
  void fly() {
    print('Flying high!');
  }
}

class Bird extends Animal with Flyable {
  Bird(String name) : super(name);
  
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('$name chirps!');
  }
}
```

**3. Async Programming:**
```dart
// Future and async/await
class ApiService {
  static const String baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';
  
  Future<List<User>> fetchUsers() async {
    try {
      final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('$baseUrl/users'));
      
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final List<dynamic> jsonData = json.decode(response.body);
        return jsonData.map((json) => User.fromJson(json)).toList();
      } else {
        throw Exception('Failed to load users');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      throw Exception('Network error: $e');
    }
  }
  
  Stream<String> countdownStream(int seconds) async* {
    for (int i = seconds; i >= 0; i--) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
      yield i.toString();
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Riverpod - Modern Provider Alternative:**
Riverpod is a complete rewrite of Provider with better performance and features.

```dart
// Provider definition
final counterProvider = StateNotifierProvider<CounterNotifier, int>((ref) {
  return CounterNotifier();
});

class CounterNotifier extends StateNotifier<int> {
  CounterNotifier() : super(0);
  
  void increment() => state++;
  void decrement() => state--;
  void reset() => state = 0;
}

// Consumer widget
class RiverpodCounterScreen extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final counter = ref.watch(counterProvider);
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Riverpod Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'Count: $counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider.notifier).decrement(),
                  child: Text('-'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider.notifier).increment(),
                  child: Text('+'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider.notifier).reset(),
                  child: Text('Reset'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**5. GetX - All-in-One Solution:**
GetX provides state management, dependency injection, and route management.

```dart
// Controller
class CounterController extends GetxController {
  var counter = 0.obs;
  
  void increment() => counter++;
  void decrement() => counter--;
  void reset() => counter.value = 0;
}

// Screen
class GetXCounterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final CounterController controller = Get.put(CounterController());
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GetX Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Obx(() => Text(
              'Count: ${controller.counter}',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
            )),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: controller.decrement,
                  child: Text('-'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: controller.increment,
                  child: Text('+'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: controller.reset,
                  child: Text('Reset'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**State Management Comparison:**

| Approach | Learning Curve | Performance | Boilerplate | Use Case |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **setState** | Easy | Good | Low | Simple local state |
| **Provider** | Medium | Good | Medium | Medium complexity apps |
| **BLoC** | Hard | Excellent | High | Large, complex apps |
| **Riverpod** | Medium | Excellent | Medium | Modern apps, testing |
| **GetX** | Easy | Good | Low | Rapid development |

**When to Use Each:**

- **setState()**: Simple widgets with local state
- **Provider**: Recommended for most Flutter apps
- **BLoC**: Large enterprise applications with complex business logic
- **Riverpod**: Modern alternative to Provider with better testing
- **GetX**: Rapid prototyping and small to medium apps

**Best Practices:**
1. Start with setState() for local state
2. Use Provider/Riverpod for app-wide state
3. Consider BLoC for complex business logic
4. Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
5. Separate business logic from UI logic
```

**5. Extension Methods:**
```dart
// Extending existing classes
extension StringExtensions on String {
  bool get isValidEmail {
    return RegExp(r'^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$').hasMatch(this);
  }
  
  String get capitalizeFirst {
    if (isEmpty) return this;
    return this[0].toUpperCase() + substring(1).toLowerCase();
  }
  
  String truncate(int maxLength) {
    if (length <= maxLength) return this;
    return '${substring(0, maxLength)}...';
  }
}

extension ListExtensions<T> on List<T> {
  T? get firstOrNull => isEmpty ? null : first;
  T? get lastOrNull => isEmpty ? null : last;
  
  List<T> get unique {
    return toSet().toList();
  }
}

// Usage
void useExtensions() {
  String email = 'user@example.com';
  print(email.isValidEmail); // true
  
  String name = 'john doe';
  print(name.capitalizeFirst); // John doe
  
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];
  print(numbers.unique); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

**6. Null Safety:**
```dart
// Null safety features
class UserProfile {
  String name; // Non-nullable
  String? email; // Nullable
  late String userId; // Late initialization
  
  UserProfile(this.name, {this.email});
  
  void initializeUserId() {
    userId = generateUserId();
  }
  
  String generateUserId() {
    return 'user_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}';
  }
  
  // Null-aware operators
  String getDisplayName() {

### Q5: How do you handle navigation in Flutter applications?

**Answer:**
Navigation is essential for multi-screen Flutter applications. Flutter provides several approaches for handling navigation, from basic routing to advanced navigation patterns.

**1. Basic Navigation with Navigator:**
Flutter's Navigator widget manages a stack of Route objects and provides methods for managing the stack.

```dart
// Basic navigation example
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'Welcome to Home Screen',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate to second screen
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(
                    builder: (context) => SecondScreen(),
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate with data
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(
                    builder: (context) => ProfileScreen(
                      userName: 'John Doe',
                      userId: 123,
                    ),
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Profile'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'This is the Second Screen',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate back
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
              child: Text('Go Back'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate back to home (pop all)
                Navigator.popUntil(context, (route) => route.isFirst);
              },
              child: Text('Back to Home'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ProfileScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String userName;
  final int userId;
  
  const ProfileScreen({
    Key? key,
    required this.userName,
    required this.userId,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Profile')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'User: $userName',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            Text(
              'ID: $userId',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
              child: Text('Back'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**2. Named Routes:**
Named routes provide a cleaner way to manage navigation in larger applications.

```dart
// Define routes in MaterialApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Navigation Demo',
      initialRoute: '/',
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
        '/second': (context) => SecondScreen(),
        '/profile': (context) => ProfileScreen(
          userName: 'Default User',
          userId: 0,
        ),
        '/settings': (context) => SettingsScreen(),
      },
      // Handle unknown routes
      onUnknownRoute: (settings) {
        return MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => NotFoundScreen(),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Navigation using named routes
class NavigationExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Named Routes')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second');
              },
              child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/settings');
              },
              child: Text('Go to Settings'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Replace current route
                Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/profile');
              },
              child: Text('Replace with Profile'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SettingsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Settings')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Settings Screen'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
              child: Text('Back'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class NotFoundScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('404')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Page Not Found'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
                context,
                '/',
                (route) => false,
              ),
              child: Text('Go Home'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**3. Passing Arguments with Named Routes:**
You can pass arguments to named routes using RouteSettings.
```dart
// Passing arguments with named routes
class ArgumentPassingExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Argument Passing')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Pass arguments using Navigator.pushNamed
                Navigator.pushNamed(
                  context,
                  '/user-profile',
                  arguments: UserArguments(
                    userId: 123,
                    userName: 'John Doe',
                    email: 'john@example.com',
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to User Profile'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Pass simple arguments
                Navigator.pushNamed(
                  context,
                  '/product-detail',
                  arguments: {
                    'productId': 456,
                    'productName': 'Flutter Book',
                    'price': 29.99,
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Product Detail'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Define argument classes
class UserArguments {
  final int userId;
  final String userName;
  final String email;
  
  UserArguments({
    required this.userId,
    required this.userName,
    required this.email,
  });
}

// Receiving arguments in destination screen
class UserProfileScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Extract arguments
    final UserArguments args = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as UserArguments;
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Profile')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Text(
              'User ID: ${args.userId}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 8),
            Text(
              'Name: ${args.userName}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 8),
            Text(
              'Email: ${args.email}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
              child: Text('Back'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ProductDetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Extract map arguments
    final Map<String, dynamic> args = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, dynamic>;
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Product Detail')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Text(
              'Product ID: ${args['productId']}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 8),
            Text(
              'Name: ${args['productName']}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 8),
            Text(
              'Price: \$${args['price']}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
              child: Text('Back'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Update MaterialApp routes
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Navigation with Arguments',
      initialRoute: '/',
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => ArgumentPassingExample(),
        '/user-profile': (context) => UserProfileScreen(),
        '/product-detail': (context) => ProductDetailScreen(),
      },
    );
  }
}
```

**4. Bottom Navigation:**
Bottom navigation provides easy access to top-level views in an app.

```dart
class BottomNavigationExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BottomNavigationExampleState createState() => _BottomNavigationExampleState();
}

class _BottomNavigationExampleState extends State<BottomNavigationExample> {
  int _currentIndex = 0;
  
  final List<Widget> _screens = [
    HomeTab(),
    SearchTab(),
    FavoritesTab(),
    ProfileTab(),
  ];
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: _screens[_currentIndex],
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
        type: BottomNavigationBarType.fixed,
        currentIndex: _currentIndex,
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index;
          });
        },
        items: [
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.home),
            label: 'Home',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            label: 'Search',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.favorite),
            label: 'Favorites',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.person),
            label: 'Profile',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Tab screens
class HomeTab extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Home Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => DetailScreen('Home Detail')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Detail'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SearchTab extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Search')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Search Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FavoritesTab extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Favorites')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Favorites Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ProfileTab extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Profile')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Profile Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  
  const DetailScreen(this.title, {Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(title)),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Detail Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**5. Drawer Navigation:**
Drawer navigation provides a slide-out menu for accessing different sections of your app.

```dart
class DrawerNavigationExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Drawer Navigation'),
        backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
      ),
      drawer: Drawer(
        child: ListView(
          padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
          children: [
            DrawerHeader(
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                gradient: LinearGradient(
                  colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.blueAccent],
                  begin: Alignment.topLeft,
                  end: Alignment.bottomRight,
                ),
              ),
              child: Column(
                crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                children: [
                  CircleAvatar(
                    radius: 30,
                    backgroundImage: NetworkImage('https://via.placeholder.com/150'),
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 10),
                  Text(
                    'John Doe',
                    style: TextStyle(
                      color: Colors.white,
                      fontSize: 18,
                      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                    ),
                  ),
                  Text(
                    'john.doe@example.com',
                    style: TextStyle(
                      color: Colors.white70,
                      fontSize: 14,
                    ),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            ListTile(
              leading: Icon(Icons.home),

      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**7. Nested Navigation and Best Practices:**

```dart
// Navigation best practices and patterns
class NavigationBestPractices {
  // 1. Use named routes for better organization
  static Map<String, WidgetBuilder> routes = {
    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
    '/profile': (context) => ProfileScreen(),
    '/settings': (context) => SettingsScreen(),
    '/login': (context) => LoginScreen(),
  };
  
  // 2. Navigation with result handling
  static Future<void> navigateForResult(BuildContext context) async {
    final result = await Navigator.push<String>(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => SelectionScreen(),
      ),
    );
    
    if (result != null) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Selected: $result')),
      );
    }
  }
  
  // 3. Conditional navigation
  static void conditionalNavigation(BuildContext context, bool isLoggedIn) {
    if (isLoggedIn) {
      Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/home');
    } else {
      Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/login');
    }
  }
  
  // 4. Clear navigation stack
  static void navigateAndClearStack(BuildContext context, String routeName) {
    Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
      context,
      routeName,
      (route) => false,
    );
  }
}

class SelectionScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> options = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'];
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Select Option')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: options.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(options[index]),
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.pop(context, options[index]);
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Navigation Comparison and Use Cases:**

| Navigation Type | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|----------------|----------|------|------|
| **Basic Navigation** | Simple app flows | Easy to implement | Can become complex |
| **Named Routes** | Medium to large apps | Organized, maintainable | Requires setup |
| **Bottom Navigation** | Main app sections | Familiar UX pattern | Limited to 5 tabs |
| **Drawer Navigation** | Many menu options | Space-efficient | Hidden by default |
| **Tab Navigation** | Related content views | Easy switching | Limited screen space |

**Best Practices:**
- Use named routes for better code organization
- Handle navigation results when needed
- Implement proper back button behavior
- Consider user experience and app flow
- Use appropriate navigation patterns for your app structure
- Test navigation on different screen sizes
- Implement deep linking for better user experience

### Q6: How do you implement animations in Flutter?

**Answer:**
Flutter provides a rich animation framework that allows you to create smooth, performant animations ranging from simple transitions to complex custom animations.

**1. Basic Animations with AnimationController:**
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class BasicAnimationExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BasicAnimationExampleState createState() => _BasicAnimationExampleState();
}

class _BasicAnimationExampleState extends State<BasicAnimationExample>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _controller;
  late Animation<double> _animation;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
      vsync: this,
    );
    
    _animation = Tween<double>(
      begin: 0.0,
      end: 1.0,
    ).animate(CurvedAnimation(
      parent: _controller,
      curve: Curves.easeInOut,
    ));
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Basic Animation')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedBuilder(
          animation: _animation,
          builder: (context, child) {
            return Transform.scale(
              scale: _animation.value,
              child: Container(
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
                ),
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Animated',
                    style: TextStyle(
                      color: Colors.white,
                      fontSize: 24,
                      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          if (_controller.isCompleted) {
            _controller.reverse();
          } else {
            _controller.forward();
          }
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**2. Implicit Animations:**
Flutter provides built-in animated widgets for common use cases.

```dart
class ImplicitAnimationExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImplicitAnimationExampleState createState() => _ImplicitAnimationExampleState();
}

class _ImplicitAnimationExampleState extends State<ImplicitAnimationExample> {
  bool _isExpanded = false;
  Color _color = Colors.blue;
  double _borderRadius = 10.0;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Implicit Animations')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // AnimatedContainer
            AnimatedContainer(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              curve: Curves.easeInOut,
              width: _isExpanded ? 300 : 150,
              height: _isExpanded ? 300 : 150,
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: _color,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(_borderRadius),
              ),
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Tap me!',
                  style: TextStyle(
                    color: Colors.white,
                    fontSize: 18,
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 30),
            
            // AnimatedOpacity
            AnimatedOpacity(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              opacity: _isExpanded ? 1.0 : 0.3,
              child: Text(
                'Fading Text',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
            
            SizedBox(height: 30),
            
            // Control buttons
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    setState(() {
                      _isExpanded = !_isExpanded;
                    });
                  },
                  child: Text('Toggle Size'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    setState(() {
                      _color = _color == Colors.blue ? Colors.red : Colors.blue;
                    });
                  },
                  child: Text('Change Color'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    setState(() {
                      _borderRadius = _borderRadius == 10.0 ? 50.0 : 10.0;
                    });
                  },
                  child: Text('Toggle Radius'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

**3. Hero Animations:**
Hero animations create smooth transitions between screens by animating shared elements.

```dart
class HeroAnimationExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hero Animation')),
      body: GridView.builder(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
        gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 2,
          crossAxisSpacing: 16,
          mainAxisSpacing: 16,
        ),
        itemCount: 6,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (context) => HeroDetailScreen(index: index),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Hero(
              tag: 'hero-$index',
              child: Container(
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  color: Colors.primaries[index % Colors.primaries.length],
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
                ),
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Item $index',
                    style: TextStyle(
                      color: Colors.white,
                      fontSize: 18,
                      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HeroDetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final int index;
  
  const HeroDetailScreen({Key? key, required this.index}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Detail $index'),
        backgroundColor: Colors.primaries[index % Colors.primaries.length],
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Hero(
            tag: 'hero-$index',
            child: Container(
              width: double.infinity,
              height: 300,
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.primaries[index % Colors.primaries.length],
              ),
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(
                    color: Colors.white,
                    fontSize: 32,
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: Padding(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
              child: Column(
                crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                children: [
                  Text(
                    'Details for Item $index',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 16),
                  Text(
                    'This is a detailed view of item $index. The hero animation smoothly transitions the shared element between screens.',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**4. Custom Animations with Tween and AnimatedBuilder:**
```dart
class CustomAnimationExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CustomAnimationExampleState createState() => _CustomAnimationExampleState();
}

class _CustomAnimationExampleState extends State<CustomAnimationExample>
    with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _rotationController;
  late AnimationController _scaleController;
  late Animation<double> _rotationAnimation;
  late Animation<double> _scaleAnimation;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    _rotationController = AnimationController(
      duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
      vsync: this,
    );
    
    _scaleController = AnimationController(
      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 800),
      vsync: this,
    );
    
    _rotationAnimation = Tween<double>(
      begin: 0,
      end: 2 * 3.14159, // 360 degrees in radians
    ).animate(CurvedAnimation(
      parent: _rotationController,
      curve: Curves.linear,
    ));
    
    _scaleAnimation = Tween<double>(
      begin: 0.5,
      end: 1.5,
    ).animate(CurvedAnimation(
      parent: _scaleController,
      curve: Curves.elasticOut,
    ));
    
    // Start continuous rotation
    _rotationController.repeat();
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _rotationController.dispose();
    _scaleController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Animations')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedBuilder(
          animation: Listenable.merge([_rotationAnimation, _scaleAnimation]),
          builder: (context, child) {
            return Transform.scale(
              scale: _scaleAnimation.value,
              child: Transform.rotate(
                angle: _rotationAnimation.value,
                child: Container(
                  width: 100,
                  height: 100,
                  decoration: BoxDecoration(
                    gradient: LinearGradient(
                      colors: [Colors.purple, Colors.pink],
                    ),
                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
                  ),
                  child: Icon(
                    Icons.star,
                    color: Colors.white,
                    size: 50,
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          if (_scaleController.isCompleted) {
            _scaleController.reverse();
          } else {
            _scaleController.forward();
          }
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.transform),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Animation Best Practices:**
- Use `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` for single animations
- Use `TickerProviderStateMixin` for multiple animations
- Always dispose animation controllers to prevent memory leaks
- Use appropriate curves for natural-feeling animations
- Consider performance impact of complex animations
- Test animations on different devices and screen sizes

### Q7: How do you handle networking and HTTP requests in Flutter?

**Answer:**
Flutter provides several ways to handle networking and HTTP requests, from simple HTTP calls to complex API integrations with proper error handling and state management.

**1. Basic HTTP Requests with http package:**
```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

// Model class
class User {
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final String email;
  final String phone;
  
  User({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.email,
    required this.phone,
  });
  
  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      id: json['id'],
      name: json['name'],
      email: json['email'],
      phone: json['phone'],
    );
  }
  
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
      'email': email,
      'phone': phone,
    };
  }
}

// Basic HTTP service
class HttpService {
  static const String baseUrl = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com';
  
  // GET request
  static Future<List<User>> getUsers() async {
    try {
      final response = await http.get(
        Uri.parse('$baseUrl/users'),
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
      );
      
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        List<dynamic> jsonList = json.decode(response.body);
        return jsonList.map((json) => User.fromJson(json)).toList();
      } else {
        throw Exception('Failed to load users: ${response.statusCode}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      throw Exception('Network error: $e');
    }
  }
  
  // POST request
  static Future<User> createUser(User user) async {
    try {
      final response = await http.post(
        Uri.parse('$baseUrl/users'),
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: json.encode(user.toJson()),
      );
      
      if (response.statusCode == 201) {
        return User.fromJson(json.decode(response.body));
      } else {
        throw Exception('Failed to create user: ${response.statusCode}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      throw Exception('Network error: $e');
    }
  }
  
  // PUT request
  static Future<User> updateUser(User user) async {
    try {
      final response = await http.put(
        Uri.parse('$baseUrl/users/${user.id}'),
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: json.encode(user.toJson()),
      );
      
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        return User.fromJson(json.decode(response.body));
      } else {
        throw Exception('Failed to update user: ${response.statusCode}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      throw Exception('Network error: $e');
    }
  }
  
  // DELETE request
  static Future<bool> deleteUser(int userId) async {
    try {
      final response = await http.delete(
        Uri.parse('$baseUrl/users/$userId'),
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
      );
      
      return response.statusCode == 200;
    } catch (e) {
      throw Exception('Network error: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Advanced HTTP Client with Dio:**
```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

class ApiService {
  late Dio _dio;
  static const String baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';
  
  ApiService() {
    _dio = Dio(BaseOptions(
      baseUrl: baseUrl,
      connectTimeout: 5000,
      receiveTimeout: 3000,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    ));
    
    // Add interceptors
    _dio.interceptors.add(
      InterceptorsWrapper(
        onRequest: (options, handler) {
          // Add authentication token
          options.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer ${getAuthToken()}';
          print('Request: ${options.method} ${options.path}');
          handler.next(options);
        },
        onResponse: (response, handler) {
          print('Response: ${response.statusCode} ${response.data}');
          handler.next(response);
        },
        onError: (error, handler) {
          print('Error: ${error.message}');
          handler.next(error);
        },
      ),
    );
    
    // Add logging interceptor
    _dio.interceptors.add(LogInterceptor(
      requestBody: true,
      responseBody: true,
    ));
  }
  
  String getAuthToken() {
    // Get token from secure storage
    return 'your_auth_token_here';
  }
  
  // Generic GET request
  Future<T> get<T>(
    String path, {
    Map<String, dynamic>? queryParameters,
    T Function(dynamic)? fromJson,
  }) async {
    try {
      final response = await _dio.get(
        path,
        queryParameters: queryParameters,
      );
      
      if (fromJson != null) {
        return fromJson(response.data);
      }
      return response.data;
    } on DioError catch (e) {
      throw _handleDioError(e);
    }
  }
  
  // Generic POST request
  Future<T> post<T>(
    String path, {
    dynamic data,
    T Function(dynamic)? fromJson,
  }) async {
    try {
      final response = await _dio.post(path, data: data);
      
      if (fromJson != null) {
        return fromJson(response.data);
      }
      return response.data;
    } on DioError catch (e) {
      throw _handleDioError(e);
    }
  }
  
  // File upload
  Future<String> uploadFile(
    String path,
    String filePath,
    String fileName,
  ) async {
    try {
      FormData formData = FormData.fromMap({
        'file': await MultipartFile.fromFile(filePath, filename: fileName),
      });
      
      final response = await _dio.post(path, data: formData);
      return response.data['url'];
    } on DioError catch (e) {
      throw _handleDioError(e);
    }
  }
  
  // File download with progress
  Future<void> downloadFile(
    String url,
    String savePath,
    Function(int, int)? onProgress,
  ) async {
    try {
      await _dio.download(
        url,
        savePath,
        onReceiveProgress: onProgress,
      );
    } on DioError catch (e) {
      throw _handleDioError(e);
    }
  }
  
  Exception _handleDioError(DioError error) {
    switch (error.type) {
      case DioErrorType.connectTimeout:
        return Exception('Connection timeout');
      case DioErrorType.sendTimeout:
        return Exception('Send timeout');
      case DioErrorType.receiveTimeout:
        return Exception('Receive timeout');
      case DioErrorType.response:
        return Exception('Server error: ${error.response?.statusCode}');
      case DioErrorType.cancel:
        return Exception('Request cancelled');
      default:
        return Exception('Network error: ${error.message}');
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Repository Pattern with Error Handling:**
```dart
// Result wrapper for better error handling
class Result<T> {
  final T? data;
  final String? error;
  final bool isSuccess;
  
  Result.success(this.data) : error = null, isSuccess = true;
  Result.error(this.error) : data = null, isSuccess = false;
}

// Repository interface
abstract class UserRepository {
  Future<Result<List<User>>> getUsers();
  Future<Result<User>> getUserById(int id);
  Future<Result<User>> createUser(User user);
  Future<Result<User>> updateUser(User user);
  Future<Result<bool>> deleteUser(int id);
}

// Repository implementation
class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {
  final ApiService _apiService;
  
  UserRepositoryImpl(this._apiService);
  
  @override
  Future<Result<List<User>>> getUsers() async {
    try {
      final users = await _apiService.get<List<User>>(
        '/users',
        fromJson: (data) => (data as List)
            .map((json) => User.fromJson(json))
            .toList(),
      );
      return Result.success(users);
    } catch (e) {
      return Result.error(e.toString());
    }
  }
  
  @override
  Future<Result<User>> getUserById(int id) async {
    try {
      final user = await _apiService.get<User>(
        '/users/$id',
        fromJson: (data) => User.fromJson(data),
      );
      return Result.success(user);
    } catch (e) {
      return Result.error(e.toString());
    }
  }
  
  @override
  Future<Result<User>> createUser(User user) async {
    try {
      final createdUser = await _apiService.post<User>(
        '/users',
        data: user.toJson(),
        fromJson: (data) => User.fromJson(data),
      );
      return Result.success(createdUser);
    } catch (e) {
      return Result.error(e.toString());
    }
  }
  
  @override
  Future<Result<User>> updateUser(User user) async {
    try {
      final updatedUser = await _apiService.post<User>(
        '/users/${user.id}',
        data: user.toJson(),
        fromJson: (data) => User.fromJson(data),
      );
      return Result.success(updatedUser);
    } catch (e) {
      return Result.error(e.toString());
    }
  }
  
  @override
  Future<Result<bool>> deleteUser(int id) async {
    try {
      await _apiService.post('/users/$id/delete');
      return Result.success(true);
    } catch (e) {
      return Result.error(e.toString());
    }
  }
}
```

**4. State Management with Networking (using Provider):**
```dart
class UserProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  final UserRepository _repository;
  
  UserProvider(this._repository);
  
  List<User> _users = [];
  bool _isLoading = false;
  String? _error;
  
  List<User> get users => _users;
  bool get isLoading => _isLoading;
  String? get error => _error;
  
  Future<void> loadUsers() async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _setError(null);
    
    final result = await _repository.getUsers();
    
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      _users = result.data!;
    } else {
      _setError(result.error!);
    }
    
    _setLoading(false);
  }
  
  Future<void> createUser(User user) async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _setError(null);
    
    final result = await _repository.createUser(user);
    
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      _users.add(result.data!);
      notifyListeners();
    } else {
      _setError(result.error!);
    }
    
    _setLoading(false);
  }
  
  Future<void> updateUser(User user) async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _setError(null);
    
    final result = await _repository.updateUser(user);
    
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      final index = _users.indexWhere((u) => u.id == user.id);
      if (index != -1) {
        _users[index] = result.data!;
        notifyListeners();
      }
    } else {
      _setError(result.error!);
    }
    
    _setLoading(false);
  }
  
  Future<void> deleteUser(int id) async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _setError(null);
    
    final result = await _repository.deleteUser(id);
    
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      _users.removeWhere((user) => user.id == id);
      notifyListeners();
    } else {

**Networking Best Practices:**

| Practice | Description | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Error Handling** | Proper exception handling and user feedback | Try-catch blocks, Result wrapper |
| **Loading States** | Show loading indicators during requests | Provider state management |
| **Retry Mechanism** | Allow users to retry failed requests | Retry buttons, pull-to-refresh |
| **Caching** | Cache responses to improve performance | SharedPreferences, Hive |
| **Timeout Configuration** | Set appropriate timeouts | Dio configuration |
| **Authentication** | Handle tokens and secure requests | Interceptors, secure storage |
| **Request Cancellation** | Cancel requests when not needed | CancelToken with Dio |
| **Offline Support** | Handle offline scenarios | Connectivity checks |

**Key Points:**
- Always handle network errors gracefully
- Use proper loading states and error messages
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Consider caching strategies for better performance
- Use interceptors for common functionality like authentication
- Test network code with different scenarios (slow network, no network)
- Follow repository pattern for better code organization
- Use proper state management for UI updates

    _isLoading = loading;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void _setError(String? error) {
    _error = error;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

### Q8: How do you implement local storage and data persistence in Flutter?

**Answer:**
Flutter provides multiple options for local storage and data persistence, ranging from simple key-value storage to complex database solutions.

**1. SharedPreferences for Simple Key-Value Storage:**
```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// Service class for SharedPreferences
class PreferencesService {
  static SharedPreferences? _preferences;
  
  // Initialize SharedPreferences
  static Future<void> init() async {
    _preferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  }
  
  // String operations
  static Future<bool> setString(String key, String value) async {
    return await _preferences?.setString(key, value) ?? false;
  }
  
  static String? getString(String key, {String? defaultValue}) {
    return _preferences?.getString(key) ?? defaultValue;
  }
  
  // Integer operations
  static Future<bool> setInt(String key, int value) async {
    return await _preferences?.setInt(key, value) ?? false;
  }
  
  static int? getInt(String key, {int? defaultValue}) {
    return _preferences?.getInt(key) ?? defaultValue;
  }
  
  // Boolean operations
  static Future<bool> setBool(String key, bool value) async {
    return await _preferences?.setBool(key, value) ?? false;
  }
  
  static bool? getBool(String key, {bool? defaultValue}) {
    return _preferences?.getBool(key) ?? defaultValue;
  }
  
  // Double operations
  static Future<bool> setDouble(String key, double value) async {
    return await _preferences?.setDouble(key, value) ?? false;
  }
  
  static double? getDouble(String key, {double? defaultValue}) {
    return _preferences?.getDouble(key) ?? defaultValue;
  }
  
  // List operations
  static Future<bool> setStringList(String key, List<String> value) async {
    return await _preferences?.setStringList(key, value) ?? false;
  }
  
  static List<String>? getStringList(String key) {
    return _preferences?.getStringList(key);
  }
  
  // Remove and clear operations
  static Future<bool> remove(String key) async {
    return await _preferences?.remove(key) ?? false;
  }
  
  static Future<bool> clear() async {
    return await _preferences?.clear() ?? false;
  }
  
  // Check if key exists
  static bool containsKey(String key) {
    return _preferences?.containsKey(key) ?? false;
  }
  
  // Get all keys
  static Set<String> getKeys() {
    return _preferences?.getKeys() ?? {};
  }
}

// Usage example
class UserPreferences {
  static const String _keyUsername = 'username';
  static const String _keyThemeMode = 'theme_mode';
  static const String _keyLanguage = 'language';
  static const String _keyIsFirstLaunch = 'is_first_launch';
  static const String _keyUserSettings = 'user_settings';
  
  // Save user data
  static Future<void> saveUsername(String username) async {
    await PreferencesService.setString(_keyUsername, username);
  }
  
  static String? getUsername() {
    return PreferencesService.getString(_keyUsername);
  }
  
  // Theme settings
  static Future<void> saveThemeMode(ThemeMode mode) async {
    await PreferencesService.setString(_keyThemeMode, mode.toString());
  }
  
  static ThemeMode getThemeMode() {
    final modeString = PreferencesService.getString(_keyThemeMode);
    switch (modeString) {
      case 'ThemeMode.dark':
        return ThemeMode.dark;
      case 'ThemeMode.light':
        return ThemeMode.light;
      default:
        return ThemeMode.system;
    }
  }
  
  // First launch check
  static Future<void> setFirstLaunchComplete() async {
    await PreferencesService.setBool(_keyIsFirstLaunch, false);
  }
  
  static bool isFirstLaunch() {
    return PreferencesService.getBool(_keyIsFirstLaunch, defaultValue: true) ?? true;
  }
  
  // Complex object storage (JSON)
  static Future<void> saveUserSettings(Map<String, dynamic> settings) async {
    final jsonString = json.encode(settings);
    await PreferencesService.setString(_keyUserSettings, jsonString);
  }
  
  static Map<String, dynamic>? getUserSettings() {
    final jsonString = PreferencesService.getString(_keyUserSettings);
    if (jsonString != null) {
      return json.decode(jsonString) as Map<String, dynamic>;
    }
    return null;
  }
}

**Storage Comparison:**

| Storage Type | Use Case | Performance | Complexity | Data Size |
|--------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **SharedPreferences** | Simple settings, user preferences | Fast | Low | Small |
| **SQLite** | Complex relational data, queries | Medium | High | Large |
| **Hive** | Object storage, offline-first apps | Very Fast | Medium | Medium-Large |
| **File Storage** | Documents, images, custom formats | Medium | Medium | Any |

**Best Practices:**
- Use SharedPreferences for simple key-value data
- Choose SQLite for complex relational data with queries
- Use Hive for fast object storage and offline-first apps
- Implement proper error handling and data validation
- Consider data encryption for sensitive information
- Use transactions for multiple related operations
- Implement data migration strategies for app updates

```

**5. Secure Storage:**
```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';

class SecureStorageService {
  static const _storage = FlutterSecureStorage(
    aOptions: AndroidOptions(
      encryptedSharedPreferences: true,

### Q9: How do you implement testing in Flutter (Unit, Widget, and Integration tests)?

**Answer:**
Flutter provides a comprehensive testing framework that supports three types of tests: unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests.

**1. Unit Tests:**
Unit tests verify the behavior of individual functions, methods, or classes.

```dart
// test/models/calculator_test.dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:my_app/models/calculator.dart';

class Calculator {
  int add(int a, int b) => a + b;
  int subtract(int a, int b) => a - b;
  int multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;
  double divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) throw ArgumentError('Cannot divide by zero');
    return a / b;
  }
  
  bool isEven(int number) => number % 2 == 0;
  
  List<int> fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return [];
    if (n == 1) return [0];
    if (n == 2) return [0, 1];
    
    List<int> sequence = [0, 1];
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
      sequence.add(sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]);
    }
    return sequence;
  }
}

void main() {
  group('Calculator Tests', () {
    late Calculator calculator;
    
    setUp(() {
      calculator = Calculator();
    });
    
    group('Basic Operations', () {
      test('should add two numbers correctly', () {
        // Arrange
        const int a = 5;
        const int b = 3;
        
        // Act
        final result = calculator.add(a, b);
        
        // Assert
        expect(result, equals(8));
      });
      
      test('should subtract two numbers correctly', () {
        expect(calculator.subtract(10, 4), equals(6));
        expect(calculator.subtract(0, 5), equals(-5));
      });
      
      test('should multiply two numbers correctly', () {
        expect(calculator.multiply(4, 5), equals(20));
        expect(calculator.multiply(-3, 4), equals(-12));
        expect(calculator.multiply(0, 100), equals(0));
      });
      
      test('should divide two numbers correctly', () {
        expect(calculator.divide(10, 2), equals(5.0));
        expect(calculator.divide(7, 2), equals(3.5));
      });
      
      test('should throw error when dividing by zero', () {
        expect(() => calculator.divide(10, 0), throwsArgumentError);
      });
    });
    
    group('Utility Functions', () {
      test('should correctly identify even numbers', () {
        expect(calculator.isEven(2), isTrue);
        expect(calculator.isEven(4), isTrue);
        expect(calculator.isEven(1), isFalse);
        expect(calculator.isEven(3), isFalse);
        expect(calculator.isEven(0), isTrue);
      });
      
      test('should generate fibonacci sequence correctly', () {
        expect(calculator.fibonacci(0), equals([]));
        expect(calculator.fibonacci(1), equals([0]));
        expect(calculator.fibonacci(2), equals([0, 1]));
        expect(calculator.fibonacci(5), equals([0, 1, 1, 2, 3]));
        expect(calculator.fibonacci(8), equals([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]));
      });
    });
  });
}
```

**2. Widget Tests:**
Widget tests verify the behavior and appearance of individual widgets.

```dart
// test/widgets/counter_widget_test.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:my_app/widgets/counter_widget.dart';

// Counter Widget Implementation

  final int initialValue;
  final VoidCallback? onIncrement;
  final VoidCallback? onDecrement;
  
  const CounterWidget({
    Key? key,
    this.initialValue = 0,
    this.onIncrement,
    this.onDecrement,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}

class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
  late int _counter;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _counter = widget.initialValue;
  }
  
  void _increment() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
    widget.onIncrement?.call();
  }
  
  void _decrement() {
    setState(() {
      _counter--;
    });
    widget.onDecrement?.call();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Counter: $_counter',
          key: const Key('counter_text'),
          style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
        ),
        const SizedBox(height: 20),
        Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              key: const Key('decrement_button'),
              onPressed: _decrement,
              child: const Icon(Icons.remove),
            ),
            const SizedBox(width: 20),

              onPressed: _increment,
              child: const Icon(Icons.add),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],

}

void main() {

        'John Doe'
      );
      await tester.enterText(
        find.byKey(const Key('email_field')), 
        'john@example.com'
      );
      
      await tester.tap(find.byKey(const Key('submit_form_button')));
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();
      
      // Verify successful submission
      expect(find.text('Form submitted successfully'), findsOneWidget);
    });
  });
}
```

**4. Advanced Testing Patterns:**

**Mock Dependencies:**
```dart
// test/mocks/mock_api_service.dart
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';
import 'package:my_app/services/api_service.dart';

class MockApiService extends Mock implements ApiService {}

// test/services/user_service_test.dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';
import 'package:my_app/services/user_service.dart';
import 'package:my_app/models/user.dart';
import '../mocks/mock_api_service.dart';

void main() {
  group('UserService Tests', () {
    late UserService userService;
    late MockApiService mockApiService;
    
    setUp(() {
      mockApiService = MockApiService();
      userService = UserService(apiService: mockApiService);
    });
    
    test('should fetch user successfully', () async {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      final expectedUser = User(
        id: userId,
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'john@example.com',
      );
      
      when(mockApiService.getUser(userId))
          .thenAnswer((_) async => expectedUser);
      
      // Act
      final result = await userService.fetchUser(userId);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result, equals(expectedUser));
      verify(mockApiService.getUser(userId)).called(1);
    });
    
    test('should handle API error gracefully', () async {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      when(mockApiService.getUser(userId))
          .thenThrow(Exception('Network error'));
      
      // Act & Assert
      expect(
        () => userService.fetchUser(userId),
        throwsA(isA<Exception>()),
      );
    });
  });
}
```

**Testing with Provider/Bloc:**
```dart
// test/providers/counter_provider_test.dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:my_app/providers/counter_provider.dart';

class CounterProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  int _count = 0;
  int get count => _count;
  
  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void decrement() {
    _count--;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void reset() {
    _count = 0;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

void main() {
  group('CounterProvider Tests', () {
    late CounterProvider counterProvider;
    
    setUp(() {
      counterProvider = CounterProvider();
    });
    
    test('initial count should be 0', () {
      expect(counterProvider.count, equals(0));
    });
    
    test('increment should increase count by 1', () {
      counterProvider.increment();
      expect(counterProvider.count, equals(1));
      
      counterProvider.increment();
      expect(counterProvider.count, equals(2));
    });
    
    test('decrement should decrease count by 1', () {
      counterProvider.increment();
      counterProvider.increment();
      
      counterProvider.decrement();
      expect(counterProvider.count, equals(1));
    });
    
    test('reset should set count to 0', () {
      counterProvider.increment();
      counterProvider.increment();
      
      counterProvider.reset();
      expect(counterProvider.count, equals(0));
    });
    
    test('should notify listeners on state change', () {
      bool notified = false;
      counterProvider.addListener(() {
        notified = true;
      });
      
      counterProvider.increment();
      expect(notified, isTrue);
    });
  });
}

// Widget test with Provider
testWidgets('CounterWidget with Provider', (WidgetTester tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (_) => CounterProvider(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          body: Consumer<CounterProvider>(
            builder: (context, counter, child) {
              return Column(
                children: [
                  Text('Count: ${counter.count}'),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    key: const Key('increment'),
                    onPressed: counter.increment,
                    child: const Text('Increment'),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
  
  expect(find.text('Count: 0'), findsOneWidget);
  
  await tester.tap(find.byKey(const Key('increment')));
  await tester.pump();
  
  expect(find.text('Count: 1'), findsOneWidget);
});
```

**Testing Best Practices:**

| Practice | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **AAA Pattern** | Arrange, Act, Assert structure | Clear test organization |
| **Descriptive Names** | Test names should describe behavior | `should_increment_counter_when_button_tapped` |
| **Single Responsibility** | One test per behavior | Separate tests for different scenarios |
| **Test Data Builders** | Create reusable test data | `UserBuilder().withName('John').build()` |
| **Mock External Dependencies** | Isolate units under test | Mock API calls, databases |
| **Test Edge Cases** | Boundary conditions, errors | Empty lists, null values, network failures |
| **Use Keys for Widgets** | Reliable widget identification | `Key('submit_button')` |
| **Pump and Settle** | Wait for animations/async operations | `await tester.pumpAndSettle()` |
| **Group Related Tests** | Organize tests logically | `group('Authentication Tests', ...)` |
| **Setup and Teardown** | Initialize/cleanup test state | `setUp()`, `tearDown()` methods |

**Test Configuration Files:**

**pubspec.yaml:**
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  integration_test:
    sdk: flutter
  mockito: ^5.4.2
  build_runner: ^2.4.7
  test: ^1.24.3
```

**test/flutter_test_config.dart:**
```dart
import 'dart:async';

Future<void> testExecutable(FutureOr<void> Function() testMain) async {
  // Global test setup
  setUpAll(() {
    // Initialize test environment
  });
  
  tearDownAll(() {
    // Cleanup after all tests
  });
  
  await testMain();
}
```

Testing in Flutter ensures code reliability, maintainability, and helps catch bugs early in the development process.

### Q10: How do you implement performance optimization in Flutter applications?

**Answer:**
Flutter performance optimization involves multiple strategies to ensure smooth 60fps rendering and efficient resource usage.

**1. Widget Performance Optimization:**
```dart
// Efficient widget building
class OptimizedListView extends StatefulWidget {
  final List<Item> items;
  
  const OptimizedListView({Key? key, required this.items}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  _OptimizedListViewState createState() => _OptimizedListViewState();
}

class _OptimizedListViewState extends State<OptimizedListView> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      // Use itemExtent for fixed-height items
      itemExtent: 80.0,
      itemCount: widget.items.length,
      // Efficient item builder
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final item = widget.items[index];
        return OptimizedListItem(
          key: ValueKey(item.id), // Stable keys for efficient updates
          item: item,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Optimized list item widget
class OptimizedListItem extends StatelessWidget {
  final Item item;
  
  const OptimizedListItem({
    Key? key,
    required this.item,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: ListTile(
        // Use const constructors when possible
        leading: const CircleAvatar(
          child: Icon(Icons.person),
        ),
        title: Text(item.title),
        subtitle: Text(item.description),
        trailing: IconButton(
          icon: const Icon(Icons.more_vert),
          onPressed: () => _showOptions(context),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
  
  void _showOptions(BuildContext context) {
    // Implement options menu
  }
}

// Use const constructors for static widgets
class StaticHeader extends StatelessWidget {
  const StaticHeader({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Card(
      child: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Text(
          'Header Title',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 24,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**2. State Management Optimization:**
```dart
// Efficient state management with Provider
class UserProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  List<User> _users = [];
  bool _isLoading = false;
  String? _error;
  
  List<User> get users => _users;
  bool get isLoading => _isLoading;
  String? get error => _error;
  
  // Batch updates to minimize rebuilds
  Future<void> loadUsers() async {
    _setLoadingState(true);
    
    try {
      final users = await _userRepository.getUsers();
      
      // Single notification for multiple state changes
      _users = users;
      _error = null;
      _isLoading = false;
      notifyListeners();
    } catch (e) {
      _error = e.toString();
      _isLoading = false;
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
  
  void _setLoadingState(bool loading) {
    if (_isLoading != loading) {
      _isLoading = loading;
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
  
  // Selective updates for specific users
  void updateUser(User updatedUser) {
    final index = _users.indexWhere((user) => user.id == updatedUser.id);
    if (index != -1) {
      _users[index] = updatedUser;
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
}

// Use Selector for granular rebuilds
class UserListWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Only rebuilds when loading state changes
        Selector<UserProvider, bool>(
          selector: (context, provider) => provider.isLoading,
          builder: (context, isLoading, child) {
            return isLoading
                ? const CircularProgressIndicator()
                : const SizedBox.shrink();
          },
        ),
        
        // Only rebuilds when users list changes
        Selector<UserProvider, List<User>>(
          selector: (context, provider) => provider.users,
          builder: (context, users, child) {
            return Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: users.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return UserTile(user: users[index]);
                },
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**3. Image and Asset Optimization:**
```dart
class OptimizedImageWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String imageUrl;
  final double? width;
  final double? height;
  
  const OptimizedImageWidget({
    Key? key,
    required this.imageUrl,
    this.width,
    this.height,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CachedNetworkImage(
      imageUrl: imageUrl,
      width: width,
      height: height,
      fit: BoxFit.cover,
      
      // Placeholder while loading
      placeholder: (context, url) => Container(
        width: width,
        height: height,
        color: Colors.grey[300],
        child: const Center(
          child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
        ),
      ),
      
      // Error widget
      errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Container(
        width: width,
        height: height,
        color: Colors.grey[300],
        child: const Icon(Icons.error),
      ),
      
      // Memory cache configuration
      memCacheWidth: width?.toInt(),
      memCacheHeight: height?.toInt(),
      
      // Disk cache configuration
      cacheManager: DefaultCacheManager(),
    );
  }
}

// Preload critical images
class ImagePreloader {
  static Future<void> preloadImages(BuildContext context, List<String> imageUrls) async {
    final futures = imageUrls.map((url) {
      return precacheImage(NetworkImage(url), context);
    });
    
    await Future.wait(futures);
  }
}

// Efficient asset loading
class AssetImageWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String assetPath;
  final double? width;
  final double? height;
  
  const AssetImageWidget({
    Key? key,
    required this.assetPath,
    this.width,
    this.height,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Image.asset(
      assetPath,
      width: width,
      height: height,
      fit: BoxFit.cover,
      // Use appropriate cache settings
      cacheWidth: width?.toInt(),
      cacheHeight: height?.toInt(),
    );
  }
}
```

**4. Memory Management:**
```dart
class MemoryEfficientWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MemoryEfficientWidgetState createState() => _MemoryEfficientWidgetState();
}

class _MemoryEfficientWidgetState extends State<MemoryEfficientWidget> {
  late StreamSubscription _subscription;
  Timer? _timer;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeResources();
  }
  
  void _initializeResources() {
    // Initialize streams and timers
    _subscription = someStream.listen((data) {
      // Handle data
    });
    
    _timer = Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (timer) {
      // Periodic task
    });
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Always dispose resources
    _subscription.cancel();
    _timer?.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Text('Memory Efficient Widget'),
    );
  }
}

// Use AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin for expensive widgets
class ExpensiveWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ExpensiveWidgetState createState() => _ExpensiveWidgetState();
}

class _ExpensiveWidgetState extends State<ExpensiveWidget>
    with AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin {
  
  @override
  bool get wantKeepAlive => true;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    super.build(context); // Required for AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin
    
    return Container(
      child: Text('Expensive Widget'),
    );
  }
}
```

**5. Build Optimization Techniques:**
```dart
// Use RepaintBoundary for complex widgets
class OptimizedComplexWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Isolate expensive repaints
        RepaintBoundary(
          child: CustomPainter(
            painter: ComplexCustomPainter(),
          ),
        ),
        
        // Regular widgets
        Text('Some text'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {},
          child: Text('Button'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Use Builder to limit rebuild scope
class ScopedRebuildWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScopedRebuildWidgetState createState() => _ScopedRebuildWidgetState();
}

class _ScopedRebuildWidgetState extends State<ScopedRebuildWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // This won't rebuild when counter changes
        const Text('Static Header'),
        
        // Only this Builder rebuilds
        Builder(
          builder: (context) {
            return Text('Counter: $_counter');
          },
        ),
        
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            setState(() {
              _counter++;
            });
          },
          child: const Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Use ValueListenableBuilder for specific value changes
class ValueListenableWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final ValueNotifier<int> counterNotifier = ValueNotifier<int>(0);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        const Text('Static Content'),
        
        ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
          valueListenable: counterNotifier,
          builder: (context, value, child) {
            return Text('Count: $value');
          },
        ),
        
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            counterNotifier.value++;
          },
          child: const Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Performance Monitoring and Debugging:**
```dart
// Performance monitoring
class PerformanceMonitor {
  static void measureBuildTime(String widgetName, VoidCallback buildFunction) {
    final stopwatch = Stopwatch()..start();
    buildFunction();
    stopwatch.stop();
    
    if (stopwatch.elapsedMilliseconds > 16) { // More than one frame
      print('Warning: $widgetName took ${stopwatch.elapsedMilliseconds}ms to build');
    }
  }
  
  static void logMemoryUsage() {
    final info = ProcessInfo.currentRss;
    print('Current memory usage: ${info / 1024 / 1024} MB');
  }
}

// Custom performance widget
class PerformanceAwareWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final String name;
  
  const PerformanceAwareWidget({
    Key? key,
    required this.child,
    required this.name,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Builder(
      builder: (context) {
        PerformanceMonitor.measureBuildTime(name, () {});
        return child;
      },
    );
  }
}
```

**Performance Best Practices:**

| Technique | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Const Constructors** | Use const for immutable widgets | Reduces widget rebuilds |
| **ListView.builder** | Build items on demand | Efficient for large lists |
| **Selector/Consumer** | Granular state listening | Minimizes unnecessary rebuilds |
| **RepaintBoundary** | Isolate expensive repaints | Improves rendering performance |
| **Image Caching** | Cache network images | Reduces network calls |
| **Lazy Loading** | Load content when needed | Improves initial load time |
| **Dispose Resources** | Clean up streams, timers | Prevents memory leaks |
| **Use Keys Wisely** | Stable keys for list items | Efficient widget updates |
| **Avoid Deep Nesting** | Flatten widget trees | Better performance |
| **Profile Regularly** | Use Flutter Inspector | Identify bottlenecks |

Regular performance profiling and optimization ensure smooth user experiences across all devices.
          .thenAnswer((_) async => Result.error('Network error'));
      
      // Act
      await userProvider.loadUsers();
      
      // Assert
      expect(userProvider.users.isEmpty, isTrue);
      expect(userProvider.isLoading, isFalse);
      expect(userProvider.error, equals('Network error'));
    });
  });
}
```

**6. Test Configuration (pubspec.yaml):**
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  integration_test:
    sdk: flutter
  mockito: ^5.4.0
  build_runner: ^2.3.3
  test: ^1.21.0
```

**7. Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run unit tests

### Q11: How do you optimize performance in Flutter applications?

**Answer:**
Flutter performance optimization involves multiple strategies across different aspects of the application, from widget management to memory usage and rendering optimization.

**1. Widget Optimization:**

```dart
// BAD: Rebuilding entire widget tree
class BadPerformanceWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BadPerformanceWidgetState createState() => _BadPerformanceWidgetState();
}

class _BadPerformanceWidgetState extends State<BadPerformanceWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        ExpensiveWidget(), // Rebuilds unnecessarily
        Text('Counter: $_counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => setState(() => _counter++),
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// GOOD: Using const constructors and separating widgets
class GoodPerformanceWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GoodPerformanceWidgetState createState() => _GoodPerformanceWidgetState();
}

class _GoodPerformanceWidgetState extends State<GoodPerformanceWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        const ExpensiveWidget(), // Won't rebuild
        CounterDisplay(counter: _counter), // Only this rebuilds
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => setState(() => _counter++),
          child: const Text('Increment'), // const constructor
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

class CounterDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  final int counter;
  
  const CounterDisplay({Key? key, required this.counter}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('Counter: $counter');
  }
}

class ExpensiveWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const ExpensiveWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Expensive computation or complex UI
    return Container(
      height: 200,
      child: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: 1000,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) => ListTile(
          title: Text('Item $index'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**2. ListView and ScrollView Optimization:**

```dart
// Optimized ListView with proper itemExtent and caching
class OptimizedListView extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> items;
  
  const OptimizedListView({Key? key, required this.items}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: items.length,
      itemExtent: 60.0, // Fixed height for better performance
      cacheExtent: 500.0, // Cache more items
      addAutomaticKeepAlives: false, // Don't keep alive unnecessarily
      addRepaintBoundaries: false, // Reduce repaint boundaries if not needed
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return OptimizedListItem(
          key: ValueKey(items[index]), // Stable keys
          title: items[index],
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class OptimizedListItem extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  
  const OptimizedListItem({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RepaintBoundary( // Isolate repaints
      child: ListTile(
        title: Text(title),
        leading: const CircleAvatar(
          child: Icon(Icons.person),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// For very large lists, use Sliver widgets
class SliverOptimizedList extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> items;
  
  const SliverOptimizedList({Key? key, required this.items}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CustomScrollView(
      slivers: [
        SliverAppBar(
          title: const Text('Optimized List'),
          floating: true,
          snap: true,
        ),
        SliverFixedExtentList(
          itemExtent: 60.0,
          delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
            (context, index) => OptimizedListItem(
              key: ValueKey(items[index]),
              title: items[index],
            ),
            childCount: items.length,
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**3. Image Optimization:**

```dart
class OptimizedImageWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String imageUrl;
  final double width;
  final double height;
  
  const OptimizedImageWidget({
    Key? key,
    required this.imageUrl,
    required this.width,
    required this.height,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      width: width,
      height: height,
      child: ClipRRect(
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
        child: Image.network(
          imageUrl,
          width: width,
          height: height,
          fit: BoxFit.cover,
          // Optimize memory usage
          cacheWidth: width.toInt(),
          cacheHeight: height.toInt(),
          // Add loading and error handling
          loadingBuilder: (context, child, loadingProgress) {
            if (loadingProgress == null) return child;
            return Center(
              child: CircularProgressIndicator(
                value: loadingProgress.expectedTotalBytes != null
                    ? loadingProgress.cumulativeBytesLoaded /
                        loadingProgress.expectedTotalBytes!
                    : null,
              ),
            );
          },
          errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace) {
            return const Center(
              child: Icon(Icons.error, color: Colors.red),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// For better image caching, use cached_network_image
class CachedImageWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String imageUrl;
  final double width;
  final double height;
  
  const CachedImageWidget({
    Key? key,
    required this.imageUrl,
    required this.width,
    required this.height,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CachedNetworkImage(
      imageUrl: imageUrl,
      width: width,
      height: height,
      fit: BoxFit.cover,
      memCacheWidth: width.toInt(),
      memCacheHeight: height.toInt(),
      placeholder: (context, url) => const Center(
        child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
      ),
      errorWidget: (context, url, error) => const Icon(Icons.error),
    );
  }
}
```

**4. State Management Optimization:**

```dart
// Using Provider with Selector for granular updates
class OptimizedProviderWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Only rebuilds when user name changes
        Selector<UserProvider, String>(
          selector: (context, provider) => provider.user.name,
          builder: (context, name, child) {
            return Text('Name: $name');
          },
        ),
        // Only rebuilds when user email changes
        Selector<UserProvider, String>(
          selector: (context, provider) => provider.user.email,
          builder: (context, email, child) {
            return Text('Email: $email');
          },
        ),
        // Static widget that never rebuilds
        Consumer<UserProvider>(
          builder: (context, provider, child) {
            return ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: provider.updateUser,
              child: child, // This child is passed from below
            );
          },
          child: const Text('Update User'), // This won't rebuild
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Using ValueNotifier for lightweight state management
class ValueNotifierExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ValueNotifierExampleState createState() => _ValueNotifierExampleState();
}

class _ValueNotifierExampleState extends State<ValueNotifierExample> {
  final ValueNotifier<int> _counter = ValueNotifier<int>(0);
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _counter.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Only this widget rebuilds when counter changes
        ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
          valueListenable: _counter,
          builder: (context, value, child) {
            return Text('Counter: $value');
          },
        ),
        // This widget never rebuilds
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _counter.value++,
          child: const Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**5. Memory Management:**

```dart
class MemoryOptimizedWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MemoryOptimizedWidgetState createState() => _MemoryOptimizedWidgetState();
}

class _MemoryOptimizedWidgetState extends State<MemoryOptimizedWidget> {
  StreamSubscription? _subscription;
  Timer? _timer;
  AnimationController? _animationController;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    // Initialize resources
    _animationController = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
      vsync: this,
    );
    
    _timer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 1), (timer) {
      // Periodic task
    });
    
    _subscription = someStream.listen((data) {
      // Handle stream data
    });
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Clean up resources to prevent memory leaks
    _animationController?.dispose();
    _timer?.cancel();
    _subscription?.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
}

// Lazy loading for expensive operations
class LazyLoadingWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<ExpensiveData>(
      future: _loadDataLazily(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return const CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
        
        if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
        }
        
        return ExpensiveDataWidget(data: snapshot.data!);
      },
    );
  }
  
  Future<ExpensiveData> _loadDataLazily() async {
    // Load data only when needed
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));
    return ExpensiveData();
  }
}
```

**6. Build Method Optimization:**

```dart
class OptimizedBuildWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OptimizedBuildWidgetState createState() => _OptimizedBuildWidgetState();
}

class _OptimizedBuildWidgetState extends State<OptimizedBuildWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;
  
  // Cache expensive computations
  late final List<Widget> _staticWidgets;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _staticWidgets = _buildStaticWidgets();
  }
  
  List<Widget> _buildStaticWidgets() {
    return List.generate(100, (index) {
      return Container(
        height: 50,
        child: Text('Static Item $index'),
      );
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Avoid creating objects in build method
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Counter: $_counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => setState(() => _counter++),
          child: const Text('Increment'),
        ),
        // Use pre-built widgets
        Expanded(
          child: ListView(children: _staticWidgets),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Use AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin for expensive widgets
class KeepAliveWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KeepAliveWidgetState createState() => _KeepAliveWidgetState();
}

class _KeepAliveWidgetState extends State<KeepAliveWidget>
    with AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin {
  
  @override
  bool get wantKeepAlive => true;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    super.build(context); // Required for AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin
    
    return ExpensiveWidget();
  }
}
```

**7. Animation Optimization:**

```dart
class OptimizedAnimationWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OptimizedAnimationWidgetState createState() => _OptimizedAnimationWidgetState();
}

class _OptimizedAnimationWidgetState extends State<OptimizedAnimationWidget>
    with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  
  late AnimationController _controller;
  late Animation<double> _animation;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
      vsync: this,
    );
    
    // Use Tween for better performance
    _animation = Tween<double>(
      begin: 0.0,
      end: 1.0,
    ).animate(CurvedAnimation(
      parent: _controller,
      curve: Curves.easeInOut,
    ));
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: _animation,
      builder: (context, child) {
        return Transform.scale(
          scale: _animation.value,
          child: child, // This child is passed from below and won't rebuild
        );
      },
      child: const ExpensiveChildWidget(), // Built once
    );
  }
}

// Use RepaintBoundary for complex animations
class RepaintBoundaryExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        RepaintBoundary(
          child: AnimatedContainer(
            duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
        // This won't repaint when the animation above changes
        const Text('Static content'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**8. Performance Monitoring:**

```dart
class PerformanceMonitor {
  static void measureBuildTime(String widgetName, VoidCallback buildFunction) {
    final stopwatch = Stopwatch()..start();
    buildFunction();
    stopwatch.stop();
    
    if (kDebugMode) {
      print('$widgetName build time: ${stopwatch.elapsedMilliseconds}ms');
    }
  }
  
  static void measureFrameTime() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
      final renderTime = WidgetsBinding.instance.renderTimeMillis;
      if (renderTime > 16) { // 60 FPS = 16.67ms per frame
        print('Frame took ${renderTime}ms (target: 16ms)');
      }
    });
  }
}

// Usage in widget
class MonitoredWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return PerformanceMonitor.measureBuildTime('MonitoredWidget', () {
      PerformanceMonitor.measureFrameTime();
      
      return Container(
        child: ExpensiveWidget(),
      );
    }) as Widget;
  }
}
```

### Q12: How do you implement platform integration and native functionality in Flutter?

**Answer:**
Flutter provides several ways to integrate with platform-specific functionality through platform channels, plugins, and native code integration.

**1. Platform Channels (Method Channels):**

```dart
// Flutter side - main.dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

class PlatformService {
  static const MethodChannel _channel = MethodChannel('com.example.app/platform');
  
  // Call native method
  static Future<String> getBatteryLevel() async {
    try {
      final int result = await _channel.invokeMethod('getBatteryLevel');
      return 'Battery level: $result%';
    } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      return 'Failed to get battery level: ${e.message}';
    }
  }
  
  // Call native method with parameters
  static Future<bool> saveToGallery(String imagePath) async {
    try {
      final bool result = await _channel.invokeMethod('saveToGallery', {
        'imagePath': imagePath,
      });
      return result;
    } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      print('Error saving to gallery: ${e.message}');
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  // Listen to native events
  static Stream<String> get locationUpdates {
    return const EventChannel('com.example.app/location')
        .receiveBroadcastStream()
        .map((dynamic event) => event.toString());
  }
}

// Usage in widget
class PlatformIntegrationWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlatformIntegrationWidgetState createState() => _PlatformIntegrationWidgetState();
}

class _PlatformIntegrationWidgetState extends State<PlatformIntegrationWidget> {
  String _batteryLevel = 'Unknown';
  StreamSubscription<String>? _locationSubscription;
  String _currentLocation = 'Unknown';
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getBatteryLevel();
    _startLocationUpdates();
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _locationSubscription?.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  Future<void> _getBatteryLevel() async {
    final batteryLevel = await PlatformService.getBatteryLevel();
    setState(() {
      _batteryLevel = batteryLevel;
    });
  }
  
  void _startLocationUpdates() {
    _locationSubscription = PlatformService.locationUpdates.listen(
      (location) {
        setState(() {
          _currentLocation = location;
        });
      },
      onError: (error) {
        print('Location error: $error');
      },
    );
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Platform Integration')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Text('Battery Level: $_batteryLevel'),
            const SizedBox(height: 16),
            Text('Location: $_currentLocation'),
            const SizedBox(height: 16),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _getBatteryLevel,
              child: const Text('Refresh Battery'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

            false
        }
    }
    
    private fun startLocationUpdates() {
        if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(
                this,
                Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION

    }
    
    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        if let location = locations.last {

**5. Creating Custom Plugin:**

```bash
# Create a new plugin
flutter create --template=plugin --platforms=android,ios my_custom_plugin
```

```dart
// lib/my_custom_plugin.dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

class MyCustomPlugin {
  static const MethodChannel _channel = MethodChannel('my_custom_plugin');
  
  static Future<String?> get platformVersion async {
    final String? version = await _channel.invokeMethod('getPlatformVersion');
    return version;
  }
  
  static Future<bool> showNativeDialog(String title, String message) async {
    try {
      final bool result = await _channel.invokeMethod('showNativeDialog', {
        'title': title,
        'message': message,
      });
      return result;
    } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      print('Error showing native dialog: ${e.message}');
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

**6. Permission Handling:**

```dart
class PermissionHandler {
  static Future<bool> requestCameraPermission() async {
    final status = await Permission.camera.request();
    return status == PermissionStatus.granted;
  }
  
  static Future<bool> requestLocationPermission() async {
    final status = await Permission.location.request();
    return status == PermissionStatus.granted;
  }
  
  static Future<bool> requestStoragePermission() async {
    final status = await Permission.storage.request();
    return status == PermissionStatus.granted;
  }
  
  static Future<Map<Permission, PermissionStatus>> requestMultiplePermissions() async {
    return await [
      Permission.camera,
      Permission.microphone,
      Permission.location,
      Permission.storage,
    ].request();
  }
  
  static Future<void> openAppSettings() async {
    await openAppSettings();
  }
}

// Usage in widget
class PermissionWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PermissionWidgetState createState() => _PermissionWidgetState();
}

class _PermissionWidgetState extends State<PermissionWidget> {
  Map<Permission, PermissionStatus> _permissions = {};
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkPermissions();
  }
  
  Future<void> _checkPermissions() async {
    final permissions = await PermissionHandler.requestMultiplePermissions();
    setState(() {
      _permissions = permissions;
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Permissions')),
      body: ListView(
        children: _permissions.entries.map((entry) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(entry.key.toString()),
            subtitle: Text(entry.value.toString()),
            trailing: entry.value == PermissionStatus.denied
                ? ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () async {
                      final status = await entry.key.request();
                      setState(() {
                        _permissions[entry.key] = status;
                      });
                    },
                    child: const Text('Request'),
                  )
                : Icon(
                    entry.value == PermissionStatus.granted
                        ? Icons.check_circle
                        : Icons.error,
                    color: entry.value == PermissionStatus.granted
                        ? Colors.green
                        : Colors.red,
                  ),
          );
        }).toList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**7. Platform-Specific UI:**

```dart
class PlatformSpecificWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Platform Specific'),
        // Platform-specific app bar
        backgroundColor: Platform.isIOS ? CupertinoColors.systemBlue : Colors.blue,
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Platform-specific button
          Platform.isIOS
              ? CupertinoButton(
                  onPressed: () {},
                  child: const Text('iOS Button'),
                )
              : ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {},
                  child: const Text('Android Button'),
                ),
          
          // Platform-specific dialog
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _showPlatformDialog(context),
            child: const Text('Show Platform Dialog'),
          ),
          
          // Platform-specific switch
          Platform.isIOS
              ? CupertinoSwitch(
                  value: true,
                  onChanged: (value) {},
                )
              : Switch(
                  value: true,
                  onChanged: (value) {},
                ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
  
  void _showPlatformDialog(BuildContext context) {
    if (Platform.isIOS) {
      showCupertinoDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => CupertinoAlertDialog(
          title: const Text('iOS Dialog'),
          content: const Text('This is a Cupertino dialog'),
          actions: [
            CupertinoDialogAction(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
              child: const Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    } else {
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: const Text('Android Dialog'),
          content: const Text('This is a Material dialog'),
          actions: [

      );
    }
  }
}
```

### Q13: How do you create custom widgets and implement widget composition in Flutter?

**Answer:**
Custom widgets in Flutter allow you to create reusable, composable UI components that encapsulate specific functionality and styling. Widget composition is a fundamental concept in Flutter for building complex UIs from simpler components.

**1. Creating Custom Stateless Widgets:**

```dart
// Simple custom widget
class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;
  final VoidCallback? onPressed;
  final Color? backgroundColor;
  final Color? textColor;
  final double? width;
  final double? height;
  final IconData? icon;
  
  const CustomButton({
    Key? key,
    required this.text,
    this.onPressed,
    this.backgroundColor,
    this.textColor,
    this.width,
    this.height,
    this.icon,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      width: width,
      height: height ?? 48,
      child: ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: onPressed,
        style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
          backgroundColor: backgroundColor ?? Theme.of(context).primaryColor,
          foregroundColor: textColor ?? Colors.white,
          shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
          ),
          elevation: 2,
        ),
        child: Row(
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            if (icon != null) ..[
              Icon(icon, size: 18),
              const SizedBox(width: 8),
            ],
            Text(
              text,
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 16,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
                color: textColor ?? Colors.white,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Advanced custom widget with multiple child widgets
class CustomCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget? header;
  final Widget? body;
  final Widget? footer;
  final EdgeInsetsGeometry? padding;
  final Color? backgroundColor;
  final double? elevation;
  final BorderRadius? borderRadius;
  
  const CustomCard({
    Key? key,
    this.header,
    this.body,
    this.footer,
    this.padding,
    this.backgroundColor,
    this.elevation,
    this.borderRadius,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      elevation: elevation ?? 4,
      color: backgroundColor ?? Colors.white,
      shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
        borderRadius: borderRadius ?? BorderRadius.circular(12),
      ),
      child: Padding(
        padding: padding ?? const EdgeInsets.all(16),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
          children: [
            if (header != null) ..[
              header!,
              const SizedBox(height: 12),
            ],
            if (body != null) ..[
              Flexible(child: body!),
            ],
            if (footer != null) ..[
              const SizedBox(height: 12),
              footer!,
            ],
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Usage examples
class CustomWidgetExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Custom Widgets')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
        child: Column(

              backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
              textColor: Colors.black87,
              width: double.infinity,
              onPressed: () => print('Secondary button pressed'),

                  Icon(Icons.person, color: Colors.blue),
                  const SizedBox(width: 8),
                  Text(
                    'User Profile',
                    style: TextStyle(
                      fontSize: 18,
                      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                    ),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
              body: Column(

                ],
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**2. Creating Custom Stateful Widgets:**

```dart
// Custom input field with validation
class CustomTextField extends StatefulWidget {
  final String label;
  final String? hint;
  final String? initialValue;
  final TextInputType? keyboardType;
  final bool obscureText;
  final String? Function(String?)? validator;
  final void Function(String)? onChanged;
  final void Function(String)? onSubmitted;
  final IconData? prefixIcon;
  final Widget? suffixIcon;
  final int? maxLines;
  final bool enabled;
  
  const CustomTextField({
    Key? key,
    required this.label,
    this.hint,
    this.initialValue,
    this.keyboardType,
    this.obscureText = false,
    this.validator,
    this.onChanged,
    this.onSubmitted,
    this.prefixIcon,
    this.suffixIcon,
    this.maxLines = 1,
    this.enabled = true,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  _CustomTextFieldState createState() => _CustomTextFieldState();
}

class _CustomTextFieldState extends State<CustomTextField> {
  late TextEditingController _controller;
  late FocusNode _focusNode;
  String? _errorText;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = TextEditingController(text: widget.initialValue);
    _focusNode = FocusNode();
    
    _focusNode.addListener(() {
      if (!_focusNode.hasFocus && widget.validator != null) {
        setState(() {
          _errorText = widget.validator!(_controller.text);
        });
      }
    });
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    _focusNode.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      children: [
        Text(
          widget.label,
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 14,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
            color: Colors.grey[700],
          ),
        ),
        const SizedBox(height: 8),
        TextFormField(
          controller: _controller,
          focusNode: _focusNode,
          keyboardType: widget.keyboardType,
          obscureText: widget.obscureText,
          maxLines: widget.maxLines,
          enabled: widget.enabled,
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: widget.hint,
            prefixIcon: widget.prefixIcon != null ? Icon(widget.prefixIcon) : null,
            suffixIcon: widget.suffixIcon,
            errorText: _errorText,
            border: OutlineInputBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
              borderSide: BorderSide(color: Colors.grey[300]!),
            ),
            enabledBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
              borderSide: BorderSide(color: Colors.grey[300]!),
            ),
            focusedBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
              borderSide: BorderSide(color: Theme.of(context).primaryColor),
            ),
            errorBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
              borderSide: const BorderSide(color: Colors.red),
            ),
            contentPadding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(
              horizontal: 16,
              vertical: 12,
            ),
          ),
          onChanged: (value) {
            widget.onChanged?.call(value);
            if (_errorText != null && widget.validator != null) {
              setState(() {
                _errorText = widget.validator!(value);
              });
            }
          },
          onFieldSubmitted: widget.onSubmitted,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Custom animated counter widget
class AnimatedCounter extends StatefulWidget {
  final int value;
  final Duration duration;
  final TextStyle? textStyle;
  
  const AnimatedCounter({
    Key? key,
    required this.value,
    this.duration = const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
    this.textStyle,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  _AnimatedCounterState createState() => _AnimatedCounterState();
}

class _AnimatedCounterState extends State<AnimatedCounter>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _controller;
  late Animation<double> _animation;
  int _previousValue = 0;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: widget.duration,
      vsync: this,
    );
    _animation = Tween<double>(
      begin: 0,
      end: widget.value.toDouble(),
    ).animate(CurvedAnimation(
      parent: _controller,
      curve: Curves.easeInOut,
    ));
    _controller.forward();
  }
  
  @override
  void didUpdateWidget(AnimatedCounter oldWidget) {
    super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
    if (oldWidget.value != widget.value) {
      _previousValue = oldWidget.value;
      _animation = Tween<double>(
        begin: _previousValue.toDouble(),
        end: widget.value.toDouble(),
      ).animate(CurvedAnimation(
        parent: _controller,
        curve: Curves.easeInOut,
      ));
      _controller.reset();
      _controller.forward();
    }
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: _animation,
      builder: (context, child) {
        return Text(
          _animation.value.round().toString(),
          style: widget.textStyle ?? TextStyle(
            fontSize: 24,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

**3. Widget Composition and Builder Patterns:**

```dart
// Composable list item widget
class ListItemWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget? leading;
  final Widget title;
  final Widget? subtitle;
  final Widget? trailing;
  final VoidCallback? onTap;
  final EdgeInsetsGeometry? padding;
  final Color? backgroundColor;
  
  const ListItemWidget({
    Key? key,
    this.leading,
    required this.title,
    this.subtitle,
    this.trailing,
    this.onTap,
    this.padding,
    this.backgroundColor,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: backgroundColor,
      child: InkWell(
        onTap: onTap,
        child: Padding(
          padding: padding ?? const EdgeInsets.all(16),
          child: Row(
            children: [
              if (leading != null) ..[
                leading!,
                const SizedBox(width: 16),
              ],
              Expanded(
                child: Column(
                  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                  children: [
                    title,
                    if (subtitle != null) ..[
                      const SizedBox(height: 4),
                      subtitle!,
                    ],
                  ],
                ),
              ),
              if (trailing != null) ..[
                const SizedBox(width: 16),
                trailing!,
              ],
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Builder widget for complex compositions
class CustomListBuilder extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<dynamic> items;
  final Widget Function(BuildContext context, dynamic item, int index) itemBuilder;
  final Widget Function(BuildContext context)? emptyBuilder;
  final Widget Function(BuildContext context)? loadingBuilder;
  final bool isLoading;
  final EdgeInsetsGeometry? padding;
  final ScrollPhysics? physics;
  
  const CustomListBuilder({
    Key? key,
    required this.items,
    required this.itemBuilder,
    this.emptyBuilder,
    this.loadingBuilder,
    this.isLoading = false,
    this.padding,
    this.physics,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (isLoading) {
      return loadingBuilder?.call(context) ?? 
          const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    }
    
    if (items.isEmpty) {
      return emptyBuilder?.call(context) ?? 
          const Center(child: Text('No items found'));
    }
    
    return ListView.builder(
      padding: padding,
      physics: physics,
      itemCount: items.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return itemBuilder(context, items[index], index);
      },
    );
  }
}

// Usage of composed widgets
class ComposedWidgetExample extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<User> users = [
    User(name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com', avatar: 'J'),
    User(name: 'Jane Smith', email: 'jane@example.com', avatar: 'J'),
    User(name: 'Bob Johnson', email: 'bob@example.com', avatar: 'B'),
  ];
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Composed Widgets')),
      body: CustomListBuilder(
        items: users,
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
        itemBuilder: (context, user, index) {
          return Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 8),
            child: ListItemWidget(
              leading: CircleAvatar(
                backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
                child: Text(
                  user.avatar,
                  style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
              title: Text(
                user.name,
                style: const TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 16,
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
                ),
              ),
              subtitle: Text(
                user.email,
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 14,
                  color: Colors.grey[600],
                ),
              ),
              trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward_ios, size: 16),
              onTap: () => print('Tapped on ${user.name}'),
              backgroundColor: Colors.grey[50],
            ),
          );
        },
        emptyBuilder: (context) => const Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Icon(Icons.people_outline, size: 64, color: Colors.grey),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              Text('No users found', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18)),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class User {
  final String name;
  final String email;
  final String avatar;
  
  User({required this.name, required this.email, required this.avatar});
}
```

**4. Advanced Custom Widget with Inherited Widget:**

```dart
// Theme provider using InheritedWidget
class CustomTheme extends InheritedWidget {
  final CustomThemeData themeData;
  
  const CustomTheme({
    Key? key,
    required this.themeData,
    required Widget child,
  }) : super(key: key, child: child);
  
  static CustomTheme? of(BuildContext context) {
    return context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<CustomTheme>();
  }
  
  @override
  bool updateShouldNotify(CustomTheme oldWidget) {
    return themeData != oldWidget.themeData;
  }
}

class CustomThemeData {
  final Color primaryColor;
  final Color secondaryColor;
  final Color backgroundColor;
  final TextStyle titleTextStyle;
  final TextStyle bodyTextStyle;
  final double borderRadius;
  
  const CustomThemeData({
    required this.primaryColor,
    required this.secondaryColor,
    required this.backgroundColor,
    required this.titleTextStyle,
    required this.bodyTextStyle,
    required this.borderRadius,
  });
  
  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) {
    if (identical(this, other)) return true;
    return other is CustomThemeData &&
        other.primaryColor == primaryColor &&
        other.secondaryColor == secondaryColor &&
        other.backgroundColor == backgroundColor &&
        other.titleTextStyle == titleTextStyle &&
        other.bodyTextStyle == bodyTextStyle &&
        other.borderRadius == borderRadius;
  }
  
  @override
  int get hashCode {
    return Object.hash(
      primaryColor,
      secondaryColor,
      backgroundColor,
      titleTextStyle,
      bodyTextStyle,
      borderRadius,
    );
  }
}

// Widget that uses the custom theme
class ThemedWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  final String content;
  
  const ThemedWidget({
    Key? key,
    required this.title,
    required this.content,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final theme = CustomTheme.of(context)?.themeData;
    
    return Container(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: theme?.backgroundColor ?? Colors.white,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(theme?.borderRadius ?? 8),
        border: Border.all(color: theme?.primaryColor ?? Colors.blue),
      ),
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
          Text(
            title,
            style: theme?.titleTextStyle ?? const TextStyle(
              fontSize: 18,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
            ),
          ),
          const SizedBox(height: 8),
          Text(
            content,
            style: theme?.bodyTextStyle ?? const TextStyle(fontSize: 14),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Usage with custom theme
class ThemedApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CustomTheme(
      themeData: const CustomThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.purple,
        secondaryColor: Colors.purpleAccent,
        backgroundColor: Colors.purple50,
        titleTextStyle: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 20,
          fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          color: Colors.purple,
        ),
        bodyTextStyle: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 16,
          color: Colors.purple700,
        ),
        borderRadius: 12,
      ),
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Themed Widgets')),
        body: const Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
          child: ThemedWidget(
            title: 'Custom Theme Example',
            content: 'This widget uses the custom theme provided by the CustomTheme InheritedWidget.',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**5. Widget Composition Best Practices:**

```dart
// Mixin for common widget functionality
mixin LoadingStateMixin<T extends StatefulWidget> on State<T> {
  bool _isLoading = false;
  
  bool get isLoading => _isLoading;
  
  void setLoading(bool loading) {
    if (mounted) {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = loading;
      });
    }
  }
  
  Widget buildWithLoading(Widget child) {
    return Stack(
      children: [
        child,
        if (_isLoading)
          Container(
            color: Colors.black26,
            child: const Center(
              child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            ),
          ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Widget that uses the mixin
class LoadingExampleWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoadingExampleWidgetState createState() => _LoadingExampleWidgetState();
}

class _LoadingExampleWidgetState extends State<LoadingExampleWidget>
    with LoadingStateMixin {
  
  Future<void> _simulateLoading() async {
    setLoading(true);
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2));
    setLoading(false);
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return buildWithLoading(
      Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Loading Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: isLoading ? null : _simulateLoading,
            child: const Text('Start Loading'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Q14: How do you implement responsive design and adaptive layouts in Flutter?

**Answer:**
Responsive design in Flutter involves creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and device types. Flutter provides several tools and techniques to build adaptive UIs that work well across phones, tablets, and desktop platforms.

**1. Using MediaQuery for Screen Information:**

```dart
class ResponsiveExample extends StatelessWidget {

### Q15: How do you handle errors and exceptions in Flutter applications?

**Answer:**
Error handling in Flutter is crucial for creating robust applications that gracefully handle unexpected situations. Flutter provides several mechanisms for catching, handling, and reporting errors at different levels of the application.

**1. Basic Exception Handling with Try-Catch:**

```dart
class ErrorHandlingExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ErrorHandlingExampleState createState() => _ErrorHandlingExampleState();
}

class _ErrorHandlingExampleState extends State<ErrorHandlingExample> {
  String _result = '';
  bool _isLoading = false;
  
  // Basic try-catch for synchronous operations
  void _performDivision() {
    try {
      int numerator = 10;
      int denominator = 0;
      double result = numerator / denominator;
      
      if (result.isInfinite) {
        throw Exception('Division by zero is not allowed');
      }
      
      setState(() {
        _result = 'Result: $result';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _result = 'Error: ${e.toString()}';
      });
      _showErrorDialog('Calculation Error', e.toString());
    }
  }
  
  // Async error handling
  Future<void> _fetchDataWithErrorHandling() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true;
      _result = '';
    });
    
    try {
      // Simulate network request
      final data = await _simulateNetworkRequest();
      setState(() {
        _result = 'Data: $data';
      });
    } on NetworkException catch (e) {
      // Handle specific network exceptions
      setState(() {
        _result = 'Network Error: ${e.message}';
      });
      _showErrorDialog('Network Error', e.message);
    } on TimeoutException catch (e) {
      // Handle timeout exceptions
      setState(() {
        _result = 'Timeout Error: Request took too long';
      });
      _showErrorDialog('Timeout', 'Request timed out. Please try again.');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any other exceptions
      setState(() {
        _result = 'Unexpected Error: ${e.toString()}';
      });
      _showErrorDialog('Error', 'An unexpected error occurred.');
    } finally {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false;
      });
    }
  }
  
  Future<String> _simulateNetworkRequest() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    
    // Simulate different types of errors
    final random = Random();
    final errorType = random.nextInt(4);
    
    switch (errorType) {
      case 0:
        throw NetworkException('Server is unreachable');
      case 1:
        throw TimeoutException('Request timeout', Duration(seconds: 30));
      case 2:
        throw FormatException('Invalid response format');
      default:
        return 'Successfully fetched data!';
    }
  }
  
  void _showErrorDialog(String title, String message) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text(title),
        content: Text(message),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('OK'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Error Handling')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _performDivision,
              child: Text('Test Division Error'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isLoading ? null : _fetchDataWithErrorHandling,
              child: _isLoading 
                ? Row(
                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                    children: [
                      SizedBox(
                        width: 16,
                        height: 16,
                        child: CircularProgressIndicator(strokeWidth: 2),
                      ),
                      SizedBox(width: 8),
                      Text('Loading...'),
                    ],
                  )
                : Text('Test Network Request'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 24),
            Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.grey[100],
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
              ),
              child: Text(
                _result.isEmpty ? 'No result yet' : _result,
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 16,
                  color: _result.startsWith('Error') ? Colors.red : Colors.black,
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom exception classes
class NetworkException implements Exception {
  final String message;
  NetworkException(this.message);
  
  @override
  String toString() => 'NetworkException: $message';
}

class TimeoutException implements Exception {
  final String message;
  final Duration timeout;
  
  TimeoutException(this.message, this.timeout);
  
  @override
  String toString() => 'TimeoutException: $message (${timeout.inSeconds}s)';
}
```

**2. Global Error Handling with FlutterError:**

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Error Handling Demo',
      home: ErrorHandlingExample(),
      builder: (context, widget) {
        // Global error handling for widget build errors
        ErrorWidget.builder = (FlutterErrorDetails errorDetails) {
          return CustomErrorWidget(errorDetails: errorDetails);
        };
        return widget!;
      },
    );
  }
}

// Custom error widget
class CustomErrorWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final FlutterErrorDetails errorDetails;
  
  const CustomErrorWidget({Key? key, required this.errorDetails}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: Colors.red[50],
      body: Center(
        child: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),

                color: Colors.red,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              Text(

                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 20,
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                  color: Colors.red[800],
                ),
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 8),

              SizedBox(height: 24),
              ElevatedButton(

                  // Restart the app or navigate to a safe screen
                  Navigator.of(context).pushAndRemoveUntil(
                    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MyApp()),
                    (route) => false,
                  );
                },
                style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(

                child: Text('Restart App'),
              ),
              if (kDebugMode) ..[
                SizedBox(height: 16),
                ExpansionTile(
                  title: Text('Debug Info'),
                  children: [
                    Padding(
                      padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
                      child: Text(
                        errorDetails.toString(),
                        style: TextStyle(
                          fontSize: 12,
                          fontFamily: 'monospace',
                        ),
                      ),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              ],
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Global error handler setup
void main() {
  // Catch Flutter framework errors
  FlutterError.onError = (FlutterErrorDetails details) {
    FlutterError.presentError(details);

  runApp(MyApp());
}

void _logErrorToCrashlytics(Object error, StackTrace? stack) {

  // like Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.
  print('Error logged: $error');
  if (stack != null) {
    print('Stack trace: $stack');

```

**3. Error Handling in State Management (Provider Example):**

```dart
class ErrorState {
  final String? message;
  final bool hasError;
  
  ErrorState({this.message, this.hasError = false});
  
  ErrorState.error(String message) : message = message, hasError = true;
  ErrorState.noError() : message = null, hasError = false;
}

class DataProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  List<String> _data = [];
  bool _isLoading = false;
  ErrorState _errorState = ErrorState.noError();
  
  List<String> get data => _data;
  bool get isLoading => _isLoading;
  ErrorState get errorState => _errorState;
  
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _clearError();
    
    try {
      // Simulate API call

    this.errorBuilder,
    this.onError,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  _ErrorBoundaryState createState() => _ErrorBoundaryState();
}

class _ErrorBoundaryState extends State<ErrorBoundary> {
  Object? _error;
  StackTrace? _stackTrace;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    // Set up error handling for this subtree
    FlutterError.onError = (FlutterErrorDetails details) {
      setState(() {
        _error = details.exception;
        _stackTrace = details.stack;
      });
      
      widget.onError?.call(details.exception, details.stack);
    };
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (_error != null) {
      return widget.errorBuilder?.call(_error!, _stackTrace) ??
          DefaultErrorWidget(error: _error!, stackTrace: _stackTrace);
    }
    
    return widget.child;
  }
  
  void reset() {
    setState(() {

  }
}

class DefaultErrorWidget extends StatelessWidget {

### Q16: What are the security best practices for Flutter applications?

**Answer:**
Security is crucial for Flutter applications, especially when handling sensitive data, user authentication, and network communications. Here are comprehensive security best practices and implementations.

**1. Secure Data Storage:**

```dart
// Using flutter_secure_storage for sensitive data
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';

class SecureStorageService {
  static const _storage = FlutterSecureStorage(
    aOptions: AndroidOptions(
      encryptedSharedPreferences: true,
      keyCipherAlgorithm: KeyCipherAlgorithm.RSA_ECB_OAESwithSHA_256andMGF1Padding,
      storageCipherAlgorithm: StorageCipherAlgorithm.AES_GCM_NoPadding,
    ),
    iOptions: IOSOptions(
      accessibility: IOSAccessibility.first_unlock_this_device,
    ),
  );
  
  // Store sensitive data
  static Future<void> storeSecureData(String key, String value) async {
    try {
      await _storage.write(key: key, value: value);
    } catch (e) {
      throw SecurityException('Failed to store secure data: $e');
    }
  }
  
  // Retrieve sensitive data
  static Future<String?> getSecureData(String key) async {
    try {
      return await _storage.read(key: key);
    } catch (e) {
      throw SecurityException('Failed to retrieve secure data: $e');
    }
  }
  
  // Delete sensitive data
  static Future<void> deleteSecureData(String key) async {
    try {
      await _storage.delete(key: key);
    } catch (e) {
      throw SecurityException('Failed to delete secure data: $e');
    }
  }
  
  // Clear all secure data
  static Future<void> clearAllSecureData() async {
    try {
      await _storage.deleteAll();
    } catch (e) {
      throw SecurityException('Failed to clear secure data: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Token management with secure storage
class TokenManager {
  static const String _accessTokenKey = 'access_token';
  static const String _refreshTokenKey = 'refresh_token';
  static const String _biometricKey = 'biometric_enabled';
  
  static Future<void> saveTokens({
    required String accessToken,
    required String refreshToken,
  }) async {
    await Future.wait([
      SecureStorageService.storeSecureData(_accessTokenKey, accessToken),
      SecureStorageService.storeSecureData(_refreshTokenKey, refreshToken),
    ]);
  }
  
  static Future<String?> getAccessToken() async {
    return await SecureStorageService.getSecureData(_accessTokenKey);
  }
  
  static Future<String?> getRefreshToken() async {
    return await SecureStorageService.getSecureData(_refreshTokenKey);
  }
  
  static Future<void> clearTokens() async {
    await Future.wait([
      SecureStorageService.deleteSecureData(_accessTokenKey),
      SecureStorageService.deleteSecureData(_refreshTokenKey),
    ]);
  }
  
  static Future<bool> hasValidTokens() async {
    final accessToken = await getAccessToken();
    return accessToken != null && accessToken.isNotEmpty;
  }
}

class SecurityException implements Exception {
  final String message;
  SecurityException(this.message);
  
  @override
  String toString() => 'SecurityException: $message';
}
```

**2. Network Security and Certificate Pinning:**

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio_certificate_pinning/dio_certificate_pinning.dart';

class SecureNetworkService {
  late Dio _dio;
  
  SecureNetworkService() {
    _dio = Dio();
    _setupSecureInterceptors();
  }
  
  void _setupSecureInterceptors() {
    // Certificate pinning
    _dio.interceptors.add(
      CertificatePinningInterceptor(
        allowedSHAFingerprints: [
          'SHA256:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=', // Your server's certificate fingerprint
        ],
      ),
    );
    
    // Request/Response interceptor for security headers
    _dio.interceptors.add(
      InterceptorsWrapper(
        onRequest: (options, handler) {
          // Add security headers
          options.headers['X-Requested-With'] = 'XMLHttpRequest';
          options.headers['X-API-Version'] = '1.0';
          
          // Add authentication token
          _addAuthToken(options);
          
          // Validate request before sending
          if (_isValidRequest(options)) {
            handler.next(options);
          } else {
            handler.reject(
              DioError(
                requestOptions: options,
                error: 'Invalid request parameters',
                type: DioErrorType.cancel,
              ),
            );
          }
        },
        onResponse: (response, handler) {
          // Validate response
          if (_isValidResponse(response)) {
            handler.next(response);
          } else {
            handler.reject(
              DioError(
                requestOptions: response.requestOptions,
                error: 'Invalid response format',
                type: DioErrorType.badResponse,
              ),
            );
          }
        },
        onError: (error, handler) {
          // Log security-related errors
          _logSecurityError(error);
          handler.next(error);
        },
      ),
    );
  }
  
  Future<void> _addAuthToken(RequestOptions options) async {
    final token = await TokenManager.getAccessToken();
    if (token != null) {
      options.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer $token';
    }
  }
  
  bool _isValidRequest(RequestOptions options) {
    // Validate URL
    if (!options.uri.toString().startsWith('https://')) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // Validate headers
    if (options.headers.containsKey('X-Malicious-Header')) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // Add more validation as needed
    return true;
  }
  
  bool _isValidResponse(Response response) {
    // Check for expected security headers
    final headers = response.headers;
    
    // Validate content type
    final contentType = headers.value('content-type');
    if (contentType != null && !contentType.contains('application/json')) {
      return false;
    }
    
    return true;
  }
  
  void _logSecurityError(DioError error) {
    // Log to security monitoring service
    print('Security Error: ${error.message}');
    // In production, send to security monitoring service
  }
}
```

**3. Input Validation and Sanitization:**

```dart
class InputValidator {
  // Email validation
  static bool isValidEmail(String email) {
    final emailRegex = RegExp(
      r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$',
    );
    return emailRegex.hasMatch(email.trim());
  }
  
  // Password strength validation
  static PasswordStrength validatePassword(String password) {
    if (password.length < 8) {
      return PasswordStrength.weak;
    }
    
    bool hasUppercase = password.contains(RegExp(r'[A-Z]'));
    bool hasLowercase = password.contains(RegExp(r'[a-z]'));
    bool hasDigits = password.contains(RegExp(r'[0-9]'));
    bool hasSpecialCharacters = password.contains(RegExp(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]'));
    
    int score = 0;
    if (hasUppercase) score++;
    if (hasLowercase) score++;
    if (hasDigits) score++;
    if (hasSpecialCharacters) score++;

  // Security settings
  static const Duration sessionTimeout = Duration(minutes: 30);
  static const int maxLoginAttempts = 3;
  static const Duration lockoutDuration = Duration(minutes: 15);
  
  // Certificate pinning fingerprints
  static const List<String> certificateFingerprints = [
    'SHA256:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=',
  ];
  
  // Allowed domains for deep links
  static const List<String> allowedDomains = [
    'example.com',
    'app.example.com',
  ];
}

// Session management
class SessionManager {
  static Timer? _sessionTimer;
  static DateTime? _lastActivity;
  
  static void startSession() {
    _lastActivity = DateTime.now();
    _resetSessionTimer();
  }
  
  static void updateActivity() {

    });
  }
  
  static void _handleSessionTimeout() {
    // Clear sensitive data
    TokenManager.clearTokens();
    
    // Navigate to login screen
    // This would typically be handled by your navigation service
    print('Session timed out - redirecting to login');
  }

  }
  
  static bool isSessionActive() {
    if (_lastActivity == null) return false;
    
    final now = DateTime.now();
    final difference = now.difference(_lastActivity!);
    return difference < SecurityConfig.sessionTimeout;
  }
}

// Root detection (Android)
class SecurityChecker {
  static Future<bool> isDeviceSecure() async {
    try {
      // Check for root/jailbreak
      final isRooted = await _checkForRoot();

    } catch (e) {
      // If we can't determine security status, assume insecure
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  static Future<bool> _checkForRoot() async {
    // This would use a plugin like 'root_check' or 'jailbreak_root_detection'
    // For demonstration purposes, we'll return false
    return false;
  }
  
  static Future<bool> _checkForDebugging() async {
    // Check if app is being debugged

  }
  
  static Future<void> handleInsecureDevice() async {
    // Clear sensitive data

    // This would typically show a dialog or navigate to a security warning screen
    print('Insecure device detected - clearing sensitive data');
  }
}
```

**Security Best Practices Summary:**

1. **Data Protection**: Use `flutter_secure_storage` for sensitive data
2. **Network Security**: Implement certificate pinning and validate all requests/responses
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
4. **Authentication**: Implement biometric authentication and secure session management
5. **Device Security**: Check for rooted/jailbroken devices
6. **Code Obfuscation**: Use code obfuscation in production builds
7. **API Security**: Use HTTPS, implement proper authentication, and validate API responses
8. **Session Management**: Implement automatic session timeout and secure token handling
9. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
10. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for security vulnerabilities

### Q17: How do you deploy Flutter applications and optimize them for app stores?

**Answer:**
Deploying Flutter applications involves building, optimizing, and publishing apps to various platforms. Here's a comprehensive guide covering deployment strategies, optimization techniques, and app store requirements.

**1. Building for Production:**

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml - Production configuration
name: my_flutter_app
description: A production-ready Flutter application

      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/CustomFont-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
```

```dart
// lib/config/app_config.dart - Environment configuration
class AppConfig {
  static const String appName = 'My Flutter App';
  static const String packageName = 'com.example.myflutterapp';
  static const String version = '1.0.0';
  static const int buildNumber = 1;
  
  // Environment-specific configurations
  static const bool isProduction = bool.fromEnvironment('PRODUCTION', defaultValue: false);
  static const bool enableAnalytics = bool.fromEnvironment('ENABLE_ANALYTICS', defaultValue: true);
  static const bool enableCrashReporting = bool.fromEnvironment('ENABLE_CRASH_REPORTING', defaultValue: true);
  
  static const String baseUrl = isProduction 
      ? 'https://api.myapp.com'
      : 'https://api-staging.myapp.com';
  
  static const String apiKey = String.fromEnvironment('API_KEY');
  static const String analyticsKey = String.fromEnvironment('ANALYTICS_KEY');
}

// lib/utils/build_info.dart - Build information
class BuildInfo {
  static Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getBuildInfo() async {
    final packageInfo = await PackageInfo.fromPlatform();
    
    return {
      'appName': packageInfo.appName,
      'packageName': packageInfo.packageName,
      'version': packageInfo.version,
      'buildNumber': packageInfo.buildNumber,
      'buildSignature': packageInfo.buildSignature,
      'isProduction': AppConfig.isProduction,

    };
  }
  
  static Future<void> logBuildInfo() async {
    final buildInfo = await getBuildInfo();
    print('Build Info: $buildInfo');
  }
}
```

**2. Android Deployment Configuration:**

```gradle

    }
}

def flutterRoot = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.sdk')
if (flutterRoot == null) {
    throw new GradleException("Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.")
}

def flutterVersionCode = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionCode')
if (flutterVersionCode == null) {
    flutterVersionCode = '1'
}

def flutterVersionName = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionName')
if (flutterVersionName == null) {
    flutterVersionName = '1.0'
}

// Keystore configuration
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

### Q18: What are advanced Flutter patterns and architecture approaches?

**Answer:**
Advanced Flutter patterns and architecture approaches help build scalable, maintainable, and testable applications. Here's a comprehensive guide covering various architectural patterns, design patterns, and advanced techniques.

**1. Clean Architecture Pattern:**

```dart
// lib/core/error/failures.dart
abstract class Failure {
  final String message;
  const Failure(this.message);
}

class ServerFailure extends Failure {
  const ServerFailure(String message) : super(message);
}

class CacheFailure extends Failure {
  const CacheFailure(String message) : super(message);
}

class NetworkFailure extends Failure {
  const NetworkFailure(String message) : super(message);
}

// lib/core/usecases/usecase.dart
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

abstract class UseCase<Type, Params> {
  Future<Either<Failure, Type>> call(Params params);
}

class NoParams {
  const NoParams();
}

// lib/features/user/domain/entities/user.dart
class User {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String email;
  final String? avatar;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final bool isActive;

  const User({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.email,
    this.avatar,
    required this.createdAt,
    required this.isActive,
  });

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) {
    if (identical(this, other)) return true;
    return other is User && other.id == id;
  }

  @override
  int get hashCode => id.hashCode;
}

// lib/features/user/domain/repositories/user_repository.dart
abstract class UserRepository {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<User>>> getUsers();
  Future<Either<Failure, User>> getUserById(String id);
  Future<Either<Failure, User>> createUser(User user);
  Future<Either<Failure, User>> updateUser(User user);
  Future<Either<Failure, void>> deleteUser(String id);
}

// lib/features/user/domain/usecases/get_users.dart
class GetUsers implements UseCase<List<User>, NoParams> {
  final UserRepository repository;

  GetUsers(this.repository);

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, List<User>>> call(NoParams params) async {
    return await repository.getUsers();
  }
}

// lib/features/user/data/models/user_model.dart
class UserModel extends User {
  const UserModel({
    required String id,
    required String name,
    required String email,
    String? avatar,
    required DateTime createdAt,
    required bool isActive,
  }) : super(
          id: id,
          name: name,
          email: email,
          avatar: avatar,
          createdAt: createdAt,
          isActive: isActive,
        );

  factory UserModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return UserModel(
      id: json['id'],
      name: json['name'],
      email: json['email'],
      avatar: json['avatar'],
      createdAt: DateTime.parse(json['created_at']),
      isActive: json['is_active'] ?? true,
    );
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
      'email': email,
      'avatar': avatar,
      'created_at': createdAt.toIso8601String(),
      'is_active': isActive,
    };
  }

  UserModel copyWith({
    String? id,
    String? name,
    String? email,
    String? avatar,
    DateTime? createdAt,
    bool? isActive,
  }) {
    return UserModel(
      id: id ?? this.id,
      name: name ?? this.name,
      email: email ?? this.email,
      avatar: avatar ?? this.avatar,
      createdAt: createdAt ?? this.createdAt,
      isActive: isActive ?? this.isActive,
    );
  }
}

// lib/features/user/data/datasources/user_remote_data_source.dart
abstract class UserRemoteDataSource {
  Future<List<UserModel>> getUsers();
  Future<UserModel> getUserById(String id);
  Future<UserModel> createUser(UserModel user);
  Future<UserModel> updateUser(UserModel user);
  Future<void> deleteUser(String id);
}

class UserRemoteDataSourceImpl implements UserRemoteDataSource {
  final http.Client client;
  final String baseUrl;

  UserRemoteDataSourceImpl({
    required this.client,
    required this.baseUrl,
  });

  @override
  Future<List<UserModel>> getUsers() async {
    final response = await client.get(
      Uri.parse('$baseUrl/users'),
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    );

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      final List<dynamic> jsonList = json.decode(response.body);
      return jsonList.map((json) => UserModel.fromJson(json)).toList();
    } else {
      throw ServerException('Failed to fetch users');
    }
  }

  @override
  Future<UserModel> createUser(UserModel user) async {
    final response = await client.post(
      Uri.parse('$baseUrl/users'),
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: json.encode(user.toJson()),
    );

    if (response.statusCode == 201) {
      return UserModel.fromJson(json.decode(response.body));
    } else {
      throw ServerException('Failed to create user');
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}

// lib/features/user/data/repositories/user_repository_impl.dart
class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {
  final UserRemoteDataSource remoteDataSource;
  final UserLocalDataSource localDataSource;
  final NetworkInfo networkInfo;

  UserRepositoryImpl({
    required this.remoteDataSource,
    required this.localDataSource,
    required this.networkInfo,
  });

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, List<User>>> getUsers() async {
    if (await networkInfo.isConnected) {
      try {
        final remoteUsers = await remoteDataSource.getUsers();
        await localDataSource.cacheUsers(remoteUsers);
        return Right(remoteUsers);
      } on ServerException catch (e) {
        return Left(ServerFailure(e.message));
      }
    } else {
      try {
        final localUsers = await localDataSource.getLastUsers();
        return Right(localUsers);
      } on CacheException catch (e) {
        return Left(CacheFailure(e.message));
      }
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**2. BLoC Pattern with Cubit:**

```dart
// lib/features/user/presentation/cubit/user_state.dart
abstract class UserState {
  const UserState();
}

class UserInitial extends UserState {
  const UserInitial();
}

class UserLoading extends UserState {
  const UserLoading();
}

class UserLoaded extends UserState {
  final List<User> users;
  final User? selectedUser;

  const UserLoaded({
    required this.users,
    this.selectedUser,
  });

  UserLoaded copyWith({
    List<User>? users,
    User? selectedUser,
  }) {
    return UserLoaded(
      users: users ?? this.users,
      selectedUser: selectedUser ?? this.selectedUser,
    );
  }
}

class UserError extends UserState {
  final String message;
  const UserError(this.message);
}

// lib/features/user/presentation/cubit/user_cubit.dart
class UserCubit extends Cubit<UserState> {
  final GetUsers getUsers;
  final CreateUser createUser;
  final UpdateUser updateUser;
  final DeleteUser deleteUser;

  UserCubit({
    required this.getUsers,
    required this.createUser,
    required this.updateUser,
    required this.deleteUser,
  }) : super(const UserInitial());

  Future<void> loadUsers() async {
    emit(const UserLoading());
    
    final result = await getUsers(const NoParams());
    
    result.fold(
      (failure) => emit(UserError(failure.message)),
      (users) => emit(UserLoaded(users: users)),
    );
  }

  Future<void> addUser(User user) async {
    if (state is UserLoaded) {
      final currentState = state as UserLoaded;
      
      final result = await createUser(CreateUserParams(user));
      
      result.fold(
        (failure) => emit(UserError(failure.message)),
        (newUser) {
          final updatedUsers = [...currentState.users, newUser];
          emit(currentState.copyWith(users: updatedUsers));
        },
      );
    }
  }

  Future<void> removeUser(String userId) async {
    if (state is UserLoaded) {
      final currentState = state as UserLoaded;
      
      final result = await deleteUser(DeleteUserParams(userId));
      
      result.fold(
        (failure) => emit(UserError(failure.message)),
        (_) {
          final updatedUsers = currentState.users
              .where((user) => user.id != userId)
              .toList();
          emit(currentState.copyWith(users: updatedUsers));
        },
      );
    }
  }

  void selectUser(User user) {
    if (state is UserLoaded) {
      final currentState = state as UserLoaded;
      emit(currentState.copyWith(selectedUser: user));
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Repository Pattern with Caching:**

```dart
// lib/core/cache/cache_manager.dart
class CacheManager {
  static const String _usersCacheKey = 'cached_users';
  static const Duration _cacheExpiry = Duration(hours: 1);
  
  final SharedPreferences _prefs;
  
  CacheManager(this._prefs);
  
  Future<void> cacheUsers(List<UserModel> users) async {
    final cacheData = {
      'data': users.map((user) => user.toJson()).toList(),
      'timestamp': DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
    };
    
    await _prefs.setString(_usersCacheKey, json.encode(cacheData));
  }
  
  Future<List<UserModel>?> getCachedUsers() async {
    final cachedString = _prefs.getString(_usersCacheKey);
    
    if (cachedString == null) return null;
    
    final cacheData = json.decode(cachedString);
    final timestamp = DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(cacheData['timestamp']);
    
    // Check if cache is expired
    if (DateTime.now().difference(timestamp) > _cacheExpiry) {
      await _prefs.remove(_usersCacheKey);
      return null;
    }
    
    final List<dynamic> usersJson = cacheData['data'];
    return usersJson.map((json) => UserModel.fromJson(json)).toList();
  }
  
  Future<void> clearCache() async {
    await _prefs.remove(_usersCacheKey);
  }
}

// lib/core/network/network_info.dart
abstract class NetworkInfo {
  Future<bool> get isConnected;
}

class NetworkInfoImpl implements NetworkInfo {
  final Connectivity connectivity;
  
  NetworkInfoImpl(this.connectivity);
  
  @override
  Future<bool> get isConnected async {
    final result = await connectivity.checkConnectivity();
    return result != ConnectivityResult.none;
  }
}
```

**4. Dependency Injection with GetIt:**

```dart
// lib/injection_container.dart
final sl = GetIt.instance;

Future<void> init() async {
  // Features - User
  _initUser();
  
  // Core
  _initCore();
  
  // External
  await _initExternal();
}

void _initUser() {
  // Cubit
  sl.registerFactory(
    () => UserCubit(
      getUsers: sl(),
      createUser: sl(),
      updateUser: sl(),
      deleteUser: sl(),
    ),
  );
  
  // Use cases
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => GetUsers(sl()));
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => CreateUser(sl()));
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => UpdateUser(sl()));
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => DeleteUser(sl()));
  
  // Repository
  sl.registerLazySingleton<UserRepository>(
    () => UserRepositoryImpl(
      remoteDataSource: sl(),
      localDataSource: sl(),
      networkInfo: sl(),
    ),
  );
  
  // Data sources
  sl.registerLazySingleton<UserRemoteDataSource>(
    () => UserRemoteDataSourceImpl(
      client: sl(),
      baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
    ),
  );
  
  sl.registerLazySingleton<UserLocalDataSource>(
    () => UserLocalDataSourceImpl(cacheManager: sl()),
  );
}

void _initCore() {
  sl.registerLazySingleton<NetworkInfo>(() => NetworkInfoImpl(sl()));
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => CacheManager(sl()));
}

Future<void> _initExternal() async {
  final sharedPreferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => sharedPreferences);
  
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => http.Client());
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => Connectivity());
}
```

**5. MVVM Pattern with Provider:**

```dart
// lib/features/user/presentation/viewmodels/user_view_model.dart
class UserViewModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  final GetUsers _getUsers;
  final CreateUser _createUser;
  final UpdateUser _updateUser;
  final DeleteUser _deleteUser;
  
  UserViewModel({
    required GetUsers getUsers,
    required CreateUser createUser,
    required UpdateUser updateUser,
    required DeleteUser deleteUser,
  }) : _getUsers = getUsers,
       _createUser = createUser,
       _updateUser = updateUser,
       _deleteUser = deleteUser;
  
  List<User> _users = [];
  User? _selectedUser;
  bool _isLoading = false;
  String? _errorMessage;
  
  // Getters
  List<User> get users => _users;
  User? get selectedUser => _selectedUser;
  bool get isLoading => _isLoading;
  String? get errorMessage => _errorMessage;
  bool get hasError => _errorMessage != null;
  
  // Methods
  Future<void> loadUsers() async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _clearError();
    
    final result = await _getUsers(const NoParams());
    
    result.fold(
      (failure) => _setError(failure.message),
      (users) => _setUsers(users),
    );
    
    _setLoading(false);
  }
  
  Future<void> addUser(User user) async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _clearError();
    
    final result = await _createUser(CreateUserParams(user));
    
    result.fold(
      (failure) => _setError(failure.message),
      (newUser) {
        _users = [..._users, newUser];
        notifyListeners();
      },
    );
    
    _setLoading(false);
  }
  
  Future<void> updateUser(User user) async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _clearError();
    
    final result = await _updateUser(UpdateUserParams(user));
    
    result.fold(
      (failure) => _setError(failure.message),
      (updatedUser) {
        final index = _users.indexWhere((u) => u.id == updatedUser.id);
        if (index != -1) {
          _users[index] = updatedUser;
          if (_selectedUser?.id == updatedUser.id) {
            _selectedUser = updatedUser;
          }
          notifyListeners();
        }
      },
    );
    
    _setLoading(false);
  }
  
  Future<void> deleteUser(String userId) async {
    _setLoading(true);
    _clearError();
    
    final result = await _deleteUser(DeleteUserParams(userId));
    
    result.fold(
      (failure) => _setError(failure.message),
      (_) {
        _users = _users.where((user) => user.id != userId).toList();
        if (_selectedUser?.id == userId) {
          _selectedUser = null;
        }
        notifyListeners();
      },
    );
    
    _setLoading(false);
  }
  
  void selectUser(User user) {
    _selectedUser = user;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void clearSelection() {
    _selectedUser = null;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  // Private methods
  void _setUsers(List<User> users) {
    _users = users;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void _setLoading(bool loading) {
    _isLoading = loading;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void _setError(String message) {
    _errorMessage = message;
    notifyListeners();
  }
  
  void _clearError() {
    _errorMessage = null;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

**6. Factory Pattern for Widget Creation:**

```dart
// lib/core/widgets/widget_factory.dart
abstract class WidgetFactory {
  Widget createButton({
    required String text,
    required VoidCallback onPressed,
    ButtonStyle? style,
  });
  
  Widget createTextField({
    required String label,
    required TextEditingController controller,
    String? hint,
    bool obscureText = false,
    String? Function(String?)? validator,
  });
  
  Widget createCard({
    required Widget child,
    EdgeInsetsGeometry? padding,
    Color? backgroundColor,
  });
}

class MaterialWidgetFactory implements WidgetFactory {
  @override
  Widget createButton({
    required String text,
    required VoidCallback onPressed,
    ButtonStyle? style,
  }) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: onPressed,
      style: style,
      child: Text(text),
    );
  }
  
  @override
  Widget createTextField({
    required String label,
    required TextEditingController controller,
    String? hint,
    bool obscureText = false,
    String? Function(String?)? validator,
  }) {
    return TextFormField(
      controller: controller,
      obscureText: obscureText,
      validator: validator,
      decoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: label,
        hintText: hint,
        border: const OutlineInputBorder(),
      ),
    );
  }
  
  @override
  Widget createCard({
    required Widget child,
    EdgeInsetsGeometry? padding,
    Color? backgroundColor,
  }) {
    return Card(
      color: backgroundColor,
      child: Padding(
        padding: padding ?? const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: child,
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CupertinoWidgetFactory implements WidgetFactory {
  @override
  Widget createButton({
    required String text,
    required VoidCallback onPressed,
    ButtonStyle? style,
  }) {
    return CupertinoButton(
      onPressed: onPressed,
      child: Text(text),
    );
  }
  
  @override
  Widget createTextField({
    required String label,
    required TextEditingController controller,
    String? hint,
    bool obscureText = false,
    String? Function(String?)? validator,
  }) {
    return CupertinoTextFormFieldRow(
      controller: controller,
      obscureText: obscureText,
      validator: validator,
      placeholder: hint,
      prefix: Text(label),
    );
  }
  
  @override
  Widget createCard({
    required Widget child,
    EdgeInsetsGeometry? padding,
    Color? backgroundColor,
  }) {
    return Container(
      padding: padding ?? const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: backgroundColor ?? CupertinoColors.systemBackground,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
        boxShadow: [
          BoxShadow(
            color: CupertinoColors.systemGrey.withOpacity(0.2),
            blurRadius: 4.0,
            offset: const Offset(0, 2),
          ),
        ],
      ),
      child: child,
    );
  }
}
```

**7. Observer Pattern for State Management:**

```dart
// lib/core/observers/app_observer.dart
abstract class Observer<T> {
  void update(T data);
}

class Subject<T> {
  final List<Observer<T>> _observers = [];
  
  void addObserver(Observer<T> observer) {
    _observers.add(observer);
  }
  
  void removeObserver(Observer<T> observer) {
    _observers.remove(observer);
  }
  
  void notifyObservers(T data) {
    for (final observer in _observers) {
      observer.update(data);
    }
  }
}

// lib/core/services/theme_service.dart
class ThemeService extends Subject<ThemeData> {
  static final ThemeService _instance = ThemeService._internal();
  factory ThemeService() => _instance;
  ThemeService._internal();
  
  ThemeData _currentTheme = ThemeData.light();
  
  ThemeData get currentTheme => _currentTheme;
  
  void changeTheme(ThemeData newTheme) {
    _currentTheme = newTheme;
    notifyObservers(_currentTheme);
  }
  
  void toggleTheme() {
    final newTheme = _currentTheme.brightness == Brightness.light
        ? ThemeData.dark()
        : ThemeData.light();
    changeTheme(newTheme);
  }
}

// lib/features/settings/presentation/widgets/theme_observer_widget.dart
class ThemeObserverWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  final Widget child;
  
  const ThemeObserverWidget({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  State<ThemeObserverWidget> createState() => _ThemeObserverWidgetState();
}

class _ThemeObserverWidgetState extends State<ThemeObserverWidget>
    implements Observer<ThemeData> {
  late ThemeData _currentTheme;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _currentTheme = ThemeService().currentTheme;
    ThemeService().addObserver(this);
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    ThemeService().removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  void update(ThemeData data) {
    setState(() {
      _currentTheme = data;
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Theme(
      data: _currentTheme,
      child: widget.child,
    );
  }
}
```

**8. Command Pattern for Actions:**

```dart
// lib/core/commands/command.dart
abstract class Command {
  Future<void> execute();
  Future<void> undo();
}

// lib/core/commands/command_manager.dart
class CommandManager {
  final List<Command> _history = [];
  int _currentIndex = -1;
  
  Future<void> executeCommand(Command command) async {
    await command.execute();
    
    // Remove any commands after current index
    if (_currentIndex < _history.length - 1) {
      _history.removeRange(_currentIndex + 1, _history.length);
    }
    
    _history.add(command);
    _currentIndex++;
  }
  
  Future<void> undo() async {
    if (canUndo) {
      await _history[_currentIndex].undo();
      _currentIndex--;
    }
  }
  
  Future<void> redo() async {
    if (canRedo) {
      _currentIndex++;
      await _history[_currentIndex].execute();
    }
  }
  
  bool get canUndo => _currentIndex >= 0;
  bool get canRedo => _currentIndex < _history.length - 1;
  
  void clear() {
    _history.clear();
    _currentIndex = -1;
  }
}

// lib/features/user/presentation/commands/create_user_command.dart
class CreateUserCommand implements Command {
  final UserRepository repository;
  final User user;
  User? _createdUser;
  
  CreateUserCommand({
    required this.repository,
    required this.user,
  });
  
  @override
  Future<void> execute() async {
    final result = await repository.createUser(user);
    result.fold(
      (failure) => throw Exception(failure.message),
      (createdUser) => _createdUser = createdUser,
    );
  }
  
  @override
  Future<void> undo() async {
    if (_createdUser != null) {
      await repository.deleteUser(_createdUser!.id);
    }
  }
}
```

**Architecture Benefits:**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Easy to unit test individual components
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features and modify existing ones
5. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the app
6. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
7. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
8. **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification

**Best Practices:**

- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper error handling at each layer
- Keep business logic in the domain layer
- Use immutable data models when possible
- Implement caching strategies for better performance
- Follow SOLID principles throughout the architecture
- Use design patterns appropriately for specific problems
- Maintain clear boundaries between layers
- Document architectural decisions and patterns used

### Q19: How do you implement internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in Flutter?

**Answer:**
Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in Flutter enable your app to support multiple languages and regions. Here's a comprehensive guide covering setup, implementation, and best practices.

**1. Basic Setup and Configuration:**

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
name: my_flutter_app
description: A Flutter app with internationalization support

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter
  intl: ^0.18.1
  intl_utils: ^2.8.5

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^2.0.0

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  generate: true
  
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/flags/

# Enable code generation for internationalization
flutter_intl:
  enabled: true
  class_name: S
  main_locale: en
  arb_dir: lib/l10n
  output_dir: lib/generated
  use_deferred_loading: false
```

```yaml
# l10n.yaml
arb-dir: lib/l10n
template-arb-file: app_en.arb
output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
output-class: AppLocalizations
output-dir: lib/generated/l10n
preferred-supported-locales: ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "ja", "ar"]
```

**2. ARB Files for Different Locales:**

import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'generated/l10n/app_localizations.dart';
import 'services/locale_service.dart';
import 'screens/home_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => LocaleService(),
      child: Consumer<LocaleService>(
        builder: (context, localeService, child) {
          return MaterialApp(
            title: 'Flutter i18n Demo',
            
            // Localization configuration
            locale: localeService.currentLocale,
            localizationsDelegates: const [
              AppLocalizations.delegate,
              GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
              GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
              GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
            ],
            supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales,
            
            // RTL support
            localeResolutionCallback: (locale, supportedLocales) {

              for (var supportedLocale in supportedLocales) {
                if (supportedLocale.languageCode == locale?.languageCode &&
                    supportedLocale.countryCode == locale?.countryCode) {
                  return supportedLocale;
                }
              }
              
              // If the locale of the device is not supported, use the first one
              // from the list (English, in this case)
              return supportedLocales.first;

        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**4. Locale Service for Language Management:**

```dart
// lib/services/locale_service.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class LocaleService extends ChangeNotifier {
  static const String _localeKey = 'selected_locale';
  
  Locale _currentLocale = const Locale('en');
  
  Locale get currentLocale => _currentLocale;
  
  // Supported locales with their display names
  static const Map<String, String> supportedLanguages = {
    'en': 'English',
    'es': 'Español',
    'fr': 'Français',
    'de': 'Deutsch',
    'ja': '日本語',
    'ar': 'العربية',
    'zh': '中文',
    'hi': 'हिन्दी',
    'pt': 'Português',
    'ru': 'Русский',
  };
  
  // RTL languages
  static const Set<String> rtlLanguages = {'ar', 'he', 'fa', 'ur'};
  
  bool get isRTL => rtlLanguages.contains(_currentLocale.languageCode);
  
  LocaleService() {
    _loadSavedLocale();
  }
  
  Future<void> _loadSavedLocale() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    final savedLocale = prefs.getString(_localeKey);
    
    if (savedLocale != null) {
      _currentLocale = Locale(savedLocale);
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
  
  Future<void> changeLocale(String languageCode) async {
    if (supportedLanguages.containsKey(languageCode)) {
      _currentLocale = Locale(languageCode);
      
      final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
      await prefs.setString(_localeKey, languageCode);
      
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
  
  String getLanguageName(String languageCode) {
    return supportedLanguages[languageCode] ?? languageCode;
  }
  
  List<Locale> getSupportedLocales() {
    return supportedLanguages.keys.map((code) => Locale(code)).toList();
  }
}
```

**5. Language Selector Widget:**

```dart
// lib/widgets/language_selector.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import '../generated/l10n/app_localizations.dart';
import '../services/locale_service.dart';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final localeService = Provider.of<LocaleService>(context);
    final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;
    
    return PopupMenuButton<String>(
      icon: Icon(Icons.language),
      tooltip: l10n.language,
      onSelected: (String languageCode) {
        localeService.changeLocale(languageCode);
      },
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context) {
        return LocaleService.supportedLanguages.entries.map((entry) {
          final isSelected = entry.key == localeService.currentLocale.languageCode;
          
          return PopupMenuItem<String>(
            value: entry.key,
            child: Row(
              children: [
                if (isSelected)
                  Icon(Icons.check, color: Theme.of(context).primaryColor)
                else
                  SizedBox(width: 24),
                SizedBox(width: 8),
                Text(
                  entry.value,
                  style: TextStyle(
                    fontWeight: isSelected ? FontWeight.bold : FontWeight.normal,
                    color: isSelected ? Theme.of(context).primaryColor : null,
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          );
        }).toList();
      },
    );
  }
}

// lib/widgets/language_list_tile.dart
class LanguageListTile extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final localeService = Provider.of<LocaleService>(context);
    final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;
    
    return ListTile(
      leading: Icon(Icons.language),
      title: Text(l10n.language),
      subtitle: Text(
        localeService.getLanguageName(localeService.currentLocale.languageCode),
      ),
      trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward_ios),
      onTap: () {
        showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => LanguageSelectionDialog(),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class LanguageSelectionDialog extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final localeService = Provider.of<LocaleService>(context);
    final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;
    
    return AlertDialog(
      title: Text(l10n.language),
      content: SizedBox(
        width: double.maxFinite,
        child: ListView.builder(
          shrinkWrap: true,
          itemCount: LocaleService.supportedLanguages.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            final entry = LocaleService.supportedLanguages.entries.elementAt(index);
            final isSelected = entry.key == localeService.currentLocale.languageCode;
            
            return RadioListTile<String>(
              title: Text(entry.value),
              value: entry.key,
              groupValue: localeService.currentLocale.languageCode,
              onChanged: (String? value) {
                if (value != null) {
                  localeService.changeLocale(value);
                  Navigator.of(context).pop();
                }
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
      actions: [
        TextButton(
          onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
          child: Text(l10n.cancel),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**6. RTL Support and Directional Widgets:**

```dart
// lib/widgets/rtl_aware_widgets.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../services/locale_service.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

class RTLAwareRow extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Widget> children;
  final MainAxisAlignment mainAxisAlignment;
  final CrossAxisAlignment crossAxisAlignment;
  
  const RTLAwareRow({
    Key? key,
    required this.children,
    this.mainAxisAlignment = MainAxisAlignment.start,
    this.crossAxisAlignment = CrossAxisAlignment.center,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final localeService = Provider.of<LocaleService>(context);
    
    return Row(
      textDirection: localeService.isRTL ? TextDirection.rtl : TextDirection.ltr,
      mainAxisAlignment: mainAxisAlignment,
      crossAxisAlignment: crossAxisAlignment,
      children: children,
    );
  }
}

class RTLAwarePadding extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final double? left;
  final double? right;
  final double? top;
  final double? bottom;
  
  const RTLAwarePadding({
    Key? key,
    required this.child,
    this.left,
    this.right,
    this.top,
    this.bottom,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final localeService = Provider.of<LocaleService>(context);
    
    return Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsetsDirectional.only(
        start: localeService.isRTL ? (right ?? 0) : (left ?? 0),
        end: localeService.isRTL ? (left ?? 0) : (right ?? 0),
        top: top ?? 0,
        bottom: bottom ?? 0,
      ),
      child: child,
    );
  }
}

class DirectionalIcon extends StatelessWidget {
  final IconData ltrIcon;
  final IconData rtlIcon;
  final double? size;
  final Color? color;
  
  const DirectionalIcon({
    Key? key,
    required this.ltrIcon,
    required this.rtlIcon,

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final localeService = Provider.of<LocaleService>(context);
    
    return Icon(
      localeService.isRTL ? rtlIcon : ltrIcon,
      size: size,
      color: color,
    );
  }
}
```

**7. Date and Number Formatting:**

```dart
// lib/utils/formatting_utils.dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class FormattingUtils {
  static String formatDate(DateTime date, Locale locale) {
    final formatter = DateFormat.yMMMd(locale.toString());
    return formatter.format(date);
  }
  
  static String formatTime(DateTime time, Locale locale) {

    return formatter.format(time);
  }
  
  static String formatDateTime(DateTime dateTime, Locale locale) {
    final formatter = DateFormat.yMMMd(locale.toString()).add_Hm();
    return formatter.format(dateTime);
  }
  
  static String formatCurrency(double amount, Locale locale, {String? symbol}) {
    final formatter = NumberFormat.currency(
      locale: locale.toString(),
      symbol: symbol,
    );
    return formatter.format(amount);
  }
  
  static String formatNumber(num number, Locale locale) {
    final formatter = NumberFormat('#,##0', locale.toString());
    return formatter.format(number);
  }
  
  static String formatPercentage(double value, Locale locale) {
    final formatter = NumberFormat.percentPattern(locale.toString());
    return formatter.format(value);
  }
  
  static String formatCompactNumber(num number, Locale locale) {
    final formatter = NumberFormat.compact(locale: locale.toString());
    return formatter.format(number);

  // Relative time formatting
  static String formatRelativeTime(DateTime dateTime, Locale locale) {
    final now = DateTime.now();
    final difference = now.difference(dateTime);
    
    if (difference.inDays > 0) {
      return formatDate(dateTime, locale);
    } else if (difference.inHours > 0) {
      return '${difference.inHours}h ago';
    } else if (difference.inMinutes > 0) {
      return '${difference.inMinutes}m ago';
    } else {
      return 'Just now';
    }
  }
}

// lib/widgets/formatted_text_widgets.dart
class FormattedDateText extends StatelessWidget {
  final DateTime date;
  final TextStyle? style;
  
  const FormattedDateText({
    Key? key,
    required this.date,
    this.style,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final locale = Localizations.localeOf(context);
    
    return Text(
      FormattingUtils.formatDate(date, locale),
      style: style,
    );
  }
}

class FormattedCurrencyText extends StatelessWidget {
  final double amount;
  final String? currencySymbol;
  final TextStyle? style;
  
  const FormattedCurrencyText({
    Key? key,
    required this.amount,
    this.currencySymbol,
    this.style,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final locale = Localizations.localeOf(context);
    
    return Text(
      FormattingUtils.formatCurrency(amount, locale, symbol: currencySymbol),
      style: style,

import '../generated/l10n/app_localizations.dart';

class ValidationUtils {
  static String? validateEmail(String? value, AppLocalizations l10n) {
    if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
      return l10n.validationEmailRequired;
    }
    
    final emailRegex = RegExp(r'^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$');

    if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
      return '$fieldName is required'; // You can add this to ARB files
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

**9. Testing Localization:**

```dart
// test/localization_test.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';
import 'package:my_flutter_app/generated/l10n/app_localizations.dart';

void main() {
  group('Localization Tests', () {
    testWidgets('English localization', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidget(
        MaterialApp(
          locale: Locale('en'),
          localizationsDelegates: [
            AppLocalizations.delegate,
            GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
            GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
          ],
          supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales,
          home: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;
              return Scaffold(
                body: Text(l10n.welcome),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      );
      
      expect(find.text('Welcome'), findsOneWidget);
    });
    
    testWidgets('Spanish localization', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidget(
        MaterialApp(
          locale: Locale('es'),
          localizationsDelegates: [
            AppLocalizations.delegate,
            GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
            GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
          ],
          supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales,
          home: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;
              return Scaffold(
                body: Text(l10n.welcome),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      );
      
      expect(find.text('Bienvenido'), findsOneWidget);
    });
    
    testWidgets('Pluralization test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidget(
        MaterialApp(
          locale: Locale('en'),
          localizationsDelegates: [
            AppLocalizations.delegate,
            GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
            GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
          ],
          supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales,
          home: Builder(

              return Scaffold(
                body: Column(
                  children: [
                    Text(l10n.itemCount(0)),
                    Text(l10n.itemCount(1)),
                    Text(l10n.itemCount(5)),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      );
      
      expect(find.text('No items'), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.text('One item'), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.text('5 items'), findsOneWidget);
    });
  });
}
```

**Best Practices:**

1. **Use ARB files** for better translation management
2. **Implement proper pluralization** for different languages
3. **Support RTL languages** with appropriate layouts
4. **Format dates, numbers, and currencies** according to locale
5. **Test all supported locales** thoroughly
6. **Use context-aware translations** when needed
7. **Implement fallback mechanisms** for missing translations
8. **Consider cultural differences** beyond language
9. **Use professional translation services** for production apps
10. **Keep translation keys descriptive** and organized

### Q20: How do you implement accessibility features in Flutter?

**Answer:**
Accessibility in Flutter ensures your app is usable by people with disabilities. Flutter provides comprehensive accessibility support through semantic widgets, screen reader compatibility, and various accessibility features.

**1. Basic Accessibility Setup:**

```dart
// lib/main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyAccessibleApp());
}

class MyAccessibleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Accessible Flutter App',
      
      // Enable accessibility debugging
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      showSemanticsDebugger: false, // Set to true for debugging
      
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        
        // High contrast theme support
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
        
        // Accessibility-friendly text theme
        textTheme: TextTheme(
          bodyLarge: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 16,
            height: 1.5, // Line height for readability
          ),
          bodyMedium: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 14,
            height: 1.4,
          ),
        ),
        
        // Ensure sufficient color contrast
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
          seedColor: Colors.blue,
          brightness: Brightness.light,
        ),
      ),
      
      // Dark theme for accessibility
      darkTheme: ThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
          seedColor: Colors.blue,
          brightness: Brightness.dark,
        ),
      ),
      
      home: AccessibleHomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

**2. Semantic Widgets and Labels:**

```dart
// lib/widgets/accessible_widgets.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/semantics.dart';

class AccessibleButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;
  final VoidCallback? onPressed;
  final String? semanticLabel;
  final String? tooltip;
  final bool isLoading;
  
  const AccessibleButton({
    Key? key,
    required this.text,
    this.onPressed,
    this.semanticLabel,
    this.tooltip,
    this.isLoading = false,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Semantics(
      label: semanticLabel ?? text,
      hint: tooltip,
      button: true,
      enabled: onPressed != null && !isLoading,
      child: Tooltip(
        message: tooltip ?? text,
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: isLoading ? null : onPressed,
          child: isLoading
              ? SizedBox(
                  width: 20,
                  height: 20,
                  child: CircularProgressIndicator(
                    strokeWidth: 2,
                    semanticsLabel: 'Loading',
                  ),
                )
              : Text(text),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AccessibleTextField extends StatelessWidget {
  final String label;
  final String? hint;
  final String? errorText;
  final TextEditingController? controller;
  final bool obscureText;
  final TextInputType? keyboardType;
  final ValueChanged<String>? onChanged;
  final String? semanticLabel;
  
  const AccessibleTextField({
    Key? key,
    required this.label,
    this.hint,
    this.errorText,
    this.controller,
    this.obscureText = false,
    this.keyboardType,
    this.onChanged,
    this.semanticLabel,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Semantics(
      label: semanticLabel ?? label,
      hint: hint,
      textField: true,
      child: TextFormField(
        controller: controller,
        obscureText: obscureText,
        keyboardType: keyboardType,
        onChanged: onChanged,
        
        // Accessibility properties
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          labelText: label,
          hintText: hint,
          errorText: errorText,
          
          // Ensure sufficient contrast
          border: OutlineInputBorder(),
          
          // Error styling for accessibility
          errorStyle: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 14,
            color: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.error,
          ),
        ),
        
        // Screen reader support
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 16, // Minimum readable size
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AccessibleCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final String? semanticLabel;
  final VoidCallback? onTap;
  final bool isSelected;
  
  const AccessibleCard({
    Key? key,
    required this.child,
    this.semanticLabel,
    this.onTap,
    this.isSelected = false,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Semantics(
      label: semanticLabel,
      button: onTap != null,
      selected: isSelected,
      child: Card(
        elevation: isSelected ? 8 : 2,
        child: InkWell(
          onTap: onTap,
          child: Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
            child: child,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**3. Screen Reader Support:**

```dart
// lib/widgets/screen_reader_widgets.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/semantics.dart';

class ScreenReaderAnnouncement extends StatefulWidget {
  final String message;
  final Widget child;
  
  const ScreenReaderAnnouncement({
    Key? key,
    required this.message,
    required this.child,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  _ScreenReaderAnnouncementState createState() => _ScreenReaderAnnouncementState();
}

class _ScreenReaderAnnouncementState extends State<ScreenReaderAnnouncement> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
      SemanticsService.announce(widget.message, TextDirection.ltr);
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return widget.child;
  }
}

class AccessibleListView extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Widget> children;
  final String? semanticLabel;
  
  const AccessibleListView({
    Key? key,
    required this.children,
    this.semanticLabel,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Semantics(
      label: semanticLabel ?? 'List with ${children.length} items',
      child: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: children.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return Semantics(
            label: 'Item ${index + 1} of ${children.length}',
            child: children[index],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AccessibleTabBar extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Tab> tabs;
  final TabController? controller;
  
  const AccessibleTabBar({
    Key? key,
    required this.tabs,
    this.controller,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Semantics(
      label: 'Tab bar with ${tabs.length} tabs',
      child: TabBar(
        controller: controller,
        tabs: tabs.asMap().entries.map((entry) {
          final index = entry.key;
          final tab = entry.value;
          
          return Semantics(
            label: 'Tab ${index + 1} of ${tabs.length}: ${tab.text}',
            selected: controller?.index == index,
            child: tab,
          );
        }).toList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**4. Focus Management:**

```dart
// lib/widgets/focus_management.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

class AccessibleForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AccessibleFormState createState() => _AccessibleFormState();
}

class _AccessibleFormState extends State<AccessibleForm> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
  final _emailController = TextEditingController();
  final _passwordController = TextEditingController();
  
  final _emailFocusNode = FocusNode();
  final _passwordFocusNode = FocusNode();
  final _submitFocusNode = FocusNode();
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _emailController.dispose();
    _passwordController.dispose();
    _emailFocusNode.dispose();
    _passwordFocusNode.dispose();
    _submitFocusNode.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  void _submitForm() {
    if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
      // Announce success to screen reader
      SemanticsService.announce(
        'Form submitted successfully',
        TextDirection.ltr,
      );
      
      // Show success message
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(
          content: Text('Login successful'),
          behavior: SnackBarBehavior.floating,
        ),
      );
    } else {
      // Announce validation errors
      SemanticsService.announce(
        'Please fix the errors in the form',
        TextDirection.ltr,
      );
    }
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Accessible Login Form'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
        child: Form(
          key: _formKey,
          child: Column(
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,
            children: [
              Semantics(
                label: 'Login form',
                child: Text(
                  'Please enter your credentials',
                  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineSmall,
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 24),
              
              // Email field with focus management
              TextFormField(
                controller: _emailController,
                focusNode: _emailFocusNode,
                keyboardType: TextInputType.emailAddress,
                textInputAction: TextInputAction.next,
                
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Email',
                  hintText: 'Enter your email address',
                  prefixIcon: Icon(Icons.email),
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                ),
                
                validator: (value) {
                  if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                    return 'Email is required';
                  }
                  if (!value.contains('@')) {
                    return 'Please enter a valid email';
                  }
                  return null;
                },
                
                onFieldSubmitted: (_) {
                  FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(_passwordFocusNode);
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              
              // Password field
              TextFormField(

                textInputAction: TextInputAction.done,
                
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Password',
                  hintText: 'Enter your password',
                  prefixIcon: Icon(Icons.lock),
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),

                validator: (value) {
                  if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                    return 'Password is required';
                  }
                  if (value.length < 6) {
                    return 'Password must be at least 6 characters';
                  }
                  return null;
                },
                
                onFieldSubmitted: (_) {
                  FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(_submitFocusNode);
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 24),
              
              // Submit button with focus
              Focus(
                focusNode: _submitFocusNode,
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _submitForm,
                  child: Padding(
                    padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 16),
                    child: Text(
                      'Login',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom focus traversal
class CustomFocusTraversalPolicy extends OrderedTraversalPolicy {
  @override
  Iterable<FocusNode> sortDescendants(Iterable<FocusNode> descendants, FocusNode currentNode) {
    return descendants.toList()
      ..sort((FocusNode a, FocusNode b) {
        // Custom sorting logic for focus order
        final aOrder = a.debugLabel?.hashCode ?? 0;
        final bOrder = b.debugLabel?.hashCode ?? 0;
        return aOrder.compareTo(bOrder);
      });
  }
}
```

**5. High Contrast and Visual Accessibility:**

```dart
// lib/themes/accessible_theme.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

class AccessibleTheme {
  static ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData(
    brightness: Brightness.light,
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
    
    // High contrast colors
    colorScheme: ColorScheme.light(
      primary: Color(0xFF0066CC),
      secondary: Color(0xFF0066CC),
      error: Color(0xFFD32F2F),
      background: Color(0xFFFFFFFF),
      surface: Color(0xFFFFFFFF),

          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**7. Testing Accessibility:**

```dart
// test/accessibility_test.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:my_app/widgets/accessible_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  group('Accessibility Tests', () {
    testWidgets('AccessibleButton has correct semantics', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidget(
        MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            body: AccessibleButton(
              text: 'Submit',
              semanticLabel: 'Submit form',
              tooltip: 'Press to submit the form',
              onPressed: () {},
            ),
          ),
        ),
      );
      
      // Test semantic properties
      final semantics = tester.getSemantics(find.byType(AccessibleButton));
      expect(semantics.label, 'Submit form');

      expect(semantics.hasFlag(SemanticsFlag.isButton), true);
      expect(semantics.hasFlag(SemanticsFlag.isEnabled), true);
    });
    
    testWidgets('AccessibleTextField has proper focus management', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      final controller = TextEditingController();
      
      await tester.pumpWidget(
        MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            body: AccessibleTextField(
              label: 'Email',
              hint: 'Enter your email',
              controller: controller,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      );
      
      // Test focus
      await tester.tap(find.byType(TextFormField));
      await tester.pump();
      
      expect(tester.binding.focusManager.primaryFocus?.hasFocus, true);
    });
    
    testWidgets('Screen reader announcements work', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      final List<String> announcements = [];
      
      tester.binding.defaultBinaryMessenger.setMockMethodCallHandler(
        SystemChannels.accessibility,
        (MethodCall methodCall) async {
          if (methodCall.method == 'announce') {
            announcements.add(methodCall.arguments['message']);
          }
          return null;
        },
      );
      
      await tester.pumpWidget(
        MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            body: ScreenReaderAnnouncement(
              message: 'Test announcement',
              child: Text('Content'),
            ),

          matching: find.byType(Container),
        ),
      );
      
      expect(container.constraints!.minWidth, 44);
      expect(container.constraints!.minHeight, 44);
    });
  });
}
```

**8. Accessibility Service Integration:**

```dart
// lib/services/accessibility_service.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

class AccessibilityService {
  static bool _isScreenReaderEnabled = false;
  static bool _isHighContrastEnabled = false;
  static double _textScaleFactor = 1.0;
  
  static bool get isScreenReaderEnabled => _isScreenReaderEnabled;
  static bool get isHighContrastEnabled => _isHighContrastEnabled;
  static double get textScaleFactor => _textScaleFactor;
  
  static Future<void> initialize() async {
    await _checkAccessibilitySettings();
  }
  
  static Future<void> _checkAccessibilitySettings() async {
    try {
      // Check if screen reader is enabled
      final bool? screenReader = await _invokeMethod('isScreenReaderEnabled');
      _isScreenReaderEnabled = screenReader ?? false;
      
      // Check if high contrast is enabled
      final bool? highContrast = await _invokeMethod('isHighContrastEnabled');
      _isHighContrastEnabled = highContrast ?? false;
      
      // Get text scale factor
      final double? textScale = await _invokeMethod('getTextScaleFactor');
      _textScaleFactor = textScale ?? 1.0;
    } catch (e) {
      debugPrint('Error checking accessibility settings: $e');
    }
  }
  
  static Future<T?> _invokeMethod<T>(String method) async {
    try {
      return await SystemChannels.accessibility.invokeMethod<T>(method);
    } catch (e) {
      debugPrint('Error invoking accessibility method $method: $e');
      return null;
    }
  }
  
  static Future<void> announceToScreenReader(String message) async {
    if (_isScreenReaderEnabled) {
      await SemanticsService.announce(message, TextDirection.ltr);
    }
  }
  
  static ThemeData getAccessibleTheme(BuildContext context) {
    if (_isHighContrastEnabled) {
      return AccessibleTheme.highContrastTheme;
    }
    
    final brightness = MediaQuery.of(context).platformBrightness;
    return brightness == Brightness.dark
        ? AccessibleTheme.darkTheme
        : AccessibleTheme.lightTheme;
  }
  
  static double getAccessibleFontSize(double baseFontSize) {
    return baseFontSize * _textScaleFactor;
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**

1. **Use semantic widgets** to provide meaningful descriptions
2. **Ensure sufficient color contrast** (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
3. **Provide alternative text** for images and icons
4. **Implement proper focus management** for keyboard navigation
5. **Use minimum touch target sizes** (44x44 points)
6. **Test with screen readers** (TalkBack on Android, VoiceOver on iOS)
7. **Support dynamic text sizing** for users with visual impairments
8. **Provide haptic feedback** for touch interactions
9. **Use descriptive error messages** and validation feedback
10. **Test accessibility** with automated tools and real users

### Q21: What are the best practices for Flutter app architecture and design patterns?

**Answer:**
Flutter app architecture is crucial for building maintainable, scalable, and testable applications. Here are the best practices and design patterns for Flutter development.

**1. Clean Architecture Implementation:**

```dart
// lib/core/architecture/base_use_case.dart
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';
import '../error/failures.dart';

abstract class UseCase<Type, Params> {
  Future<Either<Failure, Type>> call(Params params);
}

abstract class UseCaseNoParams<Type> {
  Future<Either<Failure, Type>> call();
}

class NoParams {
  const NoParams();
}

// lib/core/error/failures.dart
abstract class Failure {
  final String message;
  const Failure(this.message);
}

class ServerFailure extends Failure {
  const ServerFailure(String message) : super(message);
}

class CacheFailure extends Failure {
  const CacheFailure(String message) : super(message);
}

class NetworkFailure extends Failure {
  const NetworkFailure(String message) : super(message);
}

// lib/core/error/exceptions.dart
class ServerException implements Exception {
  final String message;
  const ServerException(this.message);
}

class CacheException implements Exception {
  final String message;
  const CacheException(this.message);
}

class NetworkException implements Exception {
  final String message;
  const NetworkException(this.message);
}
```

**2. Domain Layer (Business Logic):**

```dart
// lib/features/user/domain/entities/user.dart
class User {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String email;
  final String? avatar;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final bool isActive;
  
  const User({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.email,
    this.avatar,
    required this.createdAt,
    required this.isActive,
  });
  
  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) {
    if (identical(this, other)) return true;
    return other is User && other.id == id;
  }
  
  @override
  int get hashCode => id.hashCode;
}

// lib/features/user/domain/repositories/user_repository.dart
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';
import '../../../core/error/failures.dart';
import '../entities/user.dart';

abstract class UserRepository {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<User>>> getUsers();
  Future<Either<Failure, User>> getUserById(String id);
  Future<Either<Failure, User>> createUser(User user);
  Future<Either<Failure, User>> updateUser(User user);
  Future<Either<Failure, void>> deleteUser(String id);
  Future<Either<Failure, List<User>>> searchUsers(String query);
}

// lib/features/user/domain/usecases/get_users.dart
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';
import '../../../core/architecture/base_use_case.dart';
import '../../../core/error/failures.dart';
import '../entities/user.dart';
import '../repositories/user_repository.dart';

class GetUsers implements UseCaseNoParams<List<User>> {
  final UserRepository repository;
  
  GetUsers(this.repository);
  
  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, List<User>>> call() async {
    return await repository.getUsers();
  }
}

class GetUserById implements UseCase<User, String> {
  final UserRepository repository;
  
  GetUserById(this.repository);
  
  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, User>> call(String id) async {
    return await repository.getUserById(id);
  }
}

class CreateUser implements UseCase<User, CreateUserParams> {
  final UserRepository repository;
  
  CreateUser(this.repository);
  
  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, User>> call(CreateUserParams params) async {
    final user = User(
      id: '', // Will be generated by backend
      name: params.name,
      email: params.email,
      avatar: params.avatar,
      createdAt: DateTime.now(),
      isActive: true,
    );
    return await repository.createUser(user);
  }
}

class CreateUserParams {
  final String name;
  final String email;
  final String? avatar;
  
  const CreateUserParams({
    required this.name,
    required this.email,
    this.avatar,
  });
}
```

**3. Data Layer (Repository Implementation):**

```dart
// lib/features/user/data/models/user_model.dart
import '../../domain/entities/user.dart';

class UserModel extends User {
  const UserModel({
    required String id,
    required String name,
    required String email,
    String? avatar,
    required DateTime createdAt,
    required bool isActive,
  }) : super(
          id: id,
          name: name,
          email: email,
          avatar: avatar,
          createdAt: createdAt,
          isActive: isActive,
        );
  
  factory UserModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return UserModel(
      id: json['id'] as String,
      name: json['name'] as String,
      email: json['email'] as String,
      avatar: json['avatar'] as String?,
      createdAt: DateTime.parse(json['created_at'] as String),
      isActive: json['is_active'] as bool,
    );
  }
  
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
      'email': email,
      'avatar': avatar,
      'created_at': createdAt.toIso8601String(),
      'is_active': isActive,
    };
  }
  
  factory UserModel.fromEntity(User user) {
    return UserModel(
      id: user.id,
      name: user.name,
      email: user.email,
      avatar: user.avatar,
      createdAt: user.createdAt,
      isActive: user.isActive,
    );
  }
}

// lib/features/user/data/datasources/user_remote_data_source.dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import '../../../core/error/exceptions.dart';
import '../models/user_model.dart';

abstract class UserRemoteDataSource {
  Future<List<UserModel>> getUsers();
  Future<UserModel> getUserById(String id);
  Future<UserModel> createUser(UserModel user);
  Future<UserModel> updateUser(UserModel user);
  Future<void> deleteUser(String id);

      );
      
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {

### Q22: What is the difference between `Hot Reload` and `Hot Restart`?

**Difficulty: Easy**

**Answer:**
- **Hot Reload:** Maintains the app state while updating the code. It quickly compiles the new code file and sends it to the Dart Virtual Machine (VM). Great for UI tweaks.
- **Hot Restart:** Destroys the app state and rebuilds the app from scratch. It takes longer but is necessary when you change app initialization logic or add new assets.

---

### Q23: What is a `Future` in Dart?

**Difficulty: Easy**

**Answer:**
A `Future` represents a potential value or error that will be available at some time in the future. It is used for asynchronous operations (like fetching data from the internet). It is similar to a Promise in JavaScript.

---

### Q24: What is `Stream` in Dart?

- **UniqueKey:** Unique every time.
- **GlobalKey:** Allows access to the state of a widget from anywhere in the app (expensive, use sparingly).

---

### Q26: Explain the difference between `main()` and `runApp()`.

**Difficulty: Easy**

**Answer:**
- `main()`: The entry point of the Dart program. It initializes the program.
- `runApp()`: A Flutter function called inside `main()`. It takes the root widget and attaches it to the screen.

---

### Q27: What is `BuildContext`?

**Difficulty: Medium**

**Answer:**
`BuildContext` is a handle to the location of a widget in the widget tree. Each widget has its own `BuildContext`, which becomes the parent of the widget returned by the `build` method. It is used to locate widgets and access data up the tree (like `Theme.of(context)`).

---

### Q28: What is the `SafeArea` widget?

    if (canPlayPiano) {
      print('Playing piano');
    }
  }
}

class Musician extends Performer with Musical { ... }
```

---

### Q31: What is the difference between `const` and `final` in Dart?

**Difficulty: Easy**

**Answer:**
- **final:** Initialized at runtime. Value cannot be changed once set.
- **const:** Initialized at compile-time. Value must be known before the program runs. All `const` variables are implicitly `final`.

---

### Q32: What is `InheritedWidget`?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
`InheritedWidget` is a base class for widgets that efficiently propagate information down the tree. It allows descendant widgets to access data from an ancestor without passing it through every layer (prop drilling). `Provider` is a wrapper around `InheritedWidget`.

---

### Q33: What is the Lifecycle of a StatefulWidget?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
1. `createState()`
2. `initState()`: Called once when the state is inserted into the tree.
3. `didChangeDependencies()`: Called when a dependency changes (e.g., InheritedWidget).
4. `build()`: Renders the UI.
5. `didUpdateWidget()`: Called when the parent widget changes and reconfigures this widget.
6. `setState()`: Triggers a rebuild.
7. `deactivate()`: State object is removed from the tree.
8. `dispose()`: State object is permanently removed.

---

### Q34: What is `Isolate` in Dart?

---

### Q35: What is the difference between `Expanded` and `Flexible`?

**Difficulty: Medium**

**Answer:**
- **Expanded:** Forces the child to fill the available space. (Equivalent to `Flexible` with `fit: FlexFit.tight`).
- **Flexible:** Allows the child to be smaller than the available space if it doesn't need it all, but it can also expand. (Default `fit: FlexFit.loose`).

---

### Q36: How do you detect platform (iOS vs Android) in Flutter?

**Difficulty: Easy**

Using the `dart:io` library:
```dart
import 'dart:io' show Platform;

if (Platform.isAndroid) {
  // Android-specific code
} else if (Platform.isIOS) {
  // iOS-specific code
}
```

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/details');
```

---

### Q40: What is the BLoC pattern?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
BLoC (Business Logic Component) is a state management pattern designed to separate business logic from UI. It uses `Streams` for inputs (Events) and outputs (States).
Widgets send Events -> BLoC processes -> BLoC emits States -> UI rebuilds.

---

### Q41: What is `Riverpod`?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
A reactive caching and data-binding framework. It is considered a rewrite of `Provider` to solve its limitations (like depending on the widget tree). It is compile-safe and testable.
