# NgRx Interview Questions

### Q1: What is NgRx and why would you use it?

**Answer:**
NgRx is a reactive state management library for Angular applications, inspired by Redux. It provides a predictable state container using RxJS observables.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Predictable State**: Single source of truth
- **Immutability**: State changes are predictable
- **Time Travel Debugging**: Redux DevTools support
- **Testability**: Pure functions make testing easier
- **Performance**: OnPush change detection strategy

**Core Concepts:**
```typescript
// State - Single source of truth
interface AppState {
  users: UserState;
  products: ProductState;
  ui: UiState;
}

// Actions - Events that describe state changes
const loadUsers = createAction('[User] Load Users');
const loadUsersSuccess = createAction(
  '[User] Load Users Success',
  props<{ users: User[] }>()
);

// Reducers - Pure functions that handle state transitions
const userReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(loadUsersSuccess, (state, { users }) => ({
    ...state,
    users,
    loading: false
  }))
);

// Effects - Handle side effects
@Injectable()
export class UserEffects {
  loadUsers$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(loadUsers),
      switchMap(() =>
        this.userService.getUsers().pipe(
          map(users => loadUsersSuccess({ users })),
          catchError(error => of(loadUsersFailure({ error })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
}

// Selectors - Query the state
const selectUsers = (state: AppState) => state.users.users;
const selectUsersLoading = (state: AppState) => state.users.loading;
```

**When to Use NgRx:**
- Complex state management needs
- Multiple components sharing state
- Need for time-travel debugging
- Complex async operations
- Large team collaboration

### Q2: How do you set up NgRx Store in an Angular application?

**Answer:**
Setting up NgRx Store involves installing packages, defining state interfaces, and configuring the store module.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools
npm install @ngrx/entity @ngrx/router-store # Optional packages
```

**State Interface:**
```typescript
// models/user.model.ts
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
}

// state/user.state.ts
export interface UserState {
  users: User[];
  selectedUser: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

export const initialUserState: UserState = {
  users: [],
  selectedUser: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null
};

// state/app.state.ts
export interface AppState {
  users: UserState;
  products: ProductState;
  ui: UiState;
}
```

**Store Configuration:**
```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { StoreDevtoolsModule } from '@ngrx/store-devtools';
import { userReducer } from './state/user.reducer';
import { UserEffects } from './state/user.effects';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // Store configuration
    StoreModule.forRoot({
      users: userReducer,
      // Add other reducers here
    }),
    
    // Effects configuration
    EffectsModule.forRoot([UserEffects]),
    
    // DevTools (only in development)
    StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({
      maxAge: 25,
      logOnly: environment.production,
      autoPause: true,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**Feature Module Setup:**
```typescript
// feature/feature.module.ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forFeature('featureName', featureReducer),
    EffectsModule.forFeature([FeatureEffects])
  ]
})
export class FeatureModule {}
```

**Lazy Loading with NgRx:**
```typescript
// lazy-feature/lazy-feature.module.ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forFeature('lazyFeature', lazyFeatureReducer),
    EffectsModule.forFeature([LazyFeatureEffects])
  ]
})
export class LazyFeatureModule {}

// The state will be added when the module is loaded
```

---

### Q3: How do you create and use actions in NgRx?

**Answer:**
Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to the store.

**Creating Actions:**
```typescript
// state/user.actions.ts
import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

// Load Users Actions
export const loadUsers = createAction('[User] Load Users');

export const loadUsersSuccess = createAction(
  '[User] Load Users Success',
  props<{ users: User[] }>()
);

export const loadUsersFailure = createAction(
  '[User] Load Users Failure',
  props<{ error: string }>()
);

// Create User Actions
export const createUser = createAction(
  '[User] Create User',
  props<{ user: Omit<User, 'id'> }>()
);

export const createUserSuccess = createAction(
  '[User] Create User Success',
  props<{ user: User }>()
);

export const createUserFailure = createAction(
  '[User] Create User Failure',
  props<{ error: string }>()
);

// Update User Actions
export const updateUser = createAction(
  '[User] Update User',
  props<{ id: string; changes: Partial<User> }>()
);

export const updateUserSuccess = createAction(
  '[User] Update User Success',
  props<{ user: User }>()
);

// Delete User Actions
export const deleteUser = createAction(
  '[User] Delete User',
  props<{ id: string }>()
);

export const deleteUserSuccess = createAction(
  '[User] Delete User Success',
  props<{ id: string }>()
);

// Select User Action
export const selectUser = createAction(
  '[User] Select User',
  props<{ user: User | null }>()
);

// Clear Error Action
export const clearUserError = createAction('[User] Clear Error');
```

**Action Naming Conventions:**
```typescript
// Good action naming
export const loadUsers = createAction('[User List] Load Users');
export const loadUsersSuccess = createAction('[User API] Load Users Success');
export const loadUsersFailure = createAction('[User API] Load Users Failure');

// Component-specific actions
export const userFormSubmitted = createAction(
  '[User Form] User Form Submitted',
  props<{ user: User }>()
);

// Page-specific actions
export const userPageEntered = createAction('[User Page] User Page Entered');
export const userPageLeft = createAction('[User Page] User Page Left');
```

**Dispatching Actions:**
```typescript
// user.component.ts
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import * as UserActions from '../state/user.actions';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-list',
  template: `
    <div>
      <button (click)="loadUsers()">Load Users</button>
      <button (click)="createUser()">Create User</button>
      
      <div *ngFor="let user of users$ | async">
        <span>{{ user.name }}</span>
        <button (click)="editUser(user)">Edit</button>
        <button (click)="deleteUser(user.id)">Delete</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  `
})
export class UserListComponent {
  users$ = this.store.select(selectUsers);

  constructor(private store: Store) {}

  loadUsers(): void {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.loadUsers());
  }

  createUser(): void {
    const newUser = {
      name: 'New User',
      email: 'new@example.com',
      role: 'user' as const
    };
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.createUser({ user: newUser }));
  }

  editUser(user: User): void {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.selectUser({ user }));
  }

  deleteUser(id: string): void {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.deleteUser({ id }));
  }
}
```

**Action Unions:**
```typescript
// state/user.actions.ts
import { createAction, union } from '@ngrx/store';

// Export all actions
export const UserActions = {
  loadUsers,
  loadUsersSuccess,
  loadUsersFailure,
  createUser,
  createUserSuccess,
  createUserFailure,
  updateUser,
  updateUserSuccess,
  deleteUser,
  deleteUserSuccess,
  selectUser,
  clearUserError
};

// Create action union type
const all = union(UserActions);
export type UserActionsUnion = typeof all;
```

---

### Q4: How do you create reducers in NgRx?

**Answer:**
Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.

**Creating Reducers:**
```typescript
// state/user.reducer.ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';
import { UserState, initialUserState } from './user.state';

export const userReducer = createReducer(
  initialUserState,
  
  // Load Users
  on(UserActions.loadUsers, (state) => ({
    ...state,
    loading: true,
    error: null
  })),
  
  on(UserActions.loadUsersSuccess, (state, { users }) => ({
    ...state,
    users,
    loading: false,
    error: null
  })),
  
  on(UserActions.loadUsersFailure, (state, { error }) => ({
    ...state,
    loading: false,
    error
  })),
  
  // Create User
  on(UserActions.createUser, (state) => ({
    ...state,
    loading: true,
    error: null
  })),
  
  on(UserActions.createUserSuccess, (state, { user }) => ({
    ...state,
    users: [...state.users, user],
    loading: false,
    error: null
  })),
  
  on(UserActions.createUserFailure, (state, { error }) => ({
    ...state,
    loading: false,
    error
  })),
  
  // Update User
  on(UserActions.updateUserSuccess, (state, { user }) => ({
    ...state,
    users: state.users.map(u => u.id === user.id ? user : u),
    selectedUser: state.selectedUser?.id === user.id ? user : state.selectedUser,
    loading: false,
    error: null
  })),
  
  // Delete User
  on(UserActions.deleteUserSuccess, (state, { id }) => ({
    ...state,
    users: state.users.filter(user => user.id !== id),
    selectedUser: state.selectedUser?.id === id ? null : state.selectedUser,
    loading: false,
    error: null
  })),
  
  // Select User
  on(UserActions.selectUser, (state, { user }) => ({
    ...state,
    selectedUser: user
  })),
  
  // Clear Error
  on(UserActions.clearUserError, (state) => ({
    ...state,
    error: null
  }))
);
```

**Complex State Updates:**
```typescript
// state/shopping-cart.reducer.ts
interface CartItem {
  productId: string;
  quantity: number;
  price: number;
}

interface CartState {
  items: CartItem[];
  total: number;
  discountCode: string | null;
  discountAmount: number;
}

export const cartReducer = createReducer(
  initialCartState,
  
  on(CartActions.addToCart, (state, { productId, price }) => {
    const existingItem = state.items.find(item => item.productId === productId);
    
    if (existingItem) {
      // Update existing item
      const updatedItems = state.items.map(item =>
        item.productId === productId
          ? { ...item, quantity: item.quantity + 1 }
          : item
      );
      
      return {
        ...state,
        items: updatedItems,
        total: calculateTotal(updatedItems, state.discountAmount)
      };
    } else {
      // Add new item
      const newItems = [...state.items, { productId, quantity: 1, price }];
      
      return {
        ...state,
        items: newItems,
        total: calculateTotal(newItems, state.discountAmount)
      };
    }
  }),
  
  on(CartActions.removeFromCart, (state, { productId }) => {
    const updatedItems = state.items.filter(item => item.productId !== productId);
    
    return {
      ...state,
      items: updatedItems,
      total: calculateTotal(updatedItems, state.discountAmount)
    };
  }),
  
  on(CartActions.updateQuantity, (state, { productId, quantity }) => {
    if (quantity <= 0) {
      // Remove item if quantity is 0 or less
      const updatedItems = state.items.filter(item => item.productId !== productId);
      
      return {
        ...state,
        items: updatedItems,
        total: calculateTotal(updatedItems, state.discountAmount)
      };
    }
    
    const updatedItems = state.items.map(item =>
      item.productId === productId
        ? { ...item, quantity }
        : item
    );
    
    return {
      ...state,
      items: updatedItems,
      total: calculateTotal(updatedItems, state.discountAmount)
    };
  }),
  
  on(CartActions.applyDiscount, (state, { discountCode, discountAmount }) => ({
    ...state,
    discountCode,
    discountAmount,
    total: calculateTotal(state.items, discountAmount)
  }))
);

// Helper function
function calculateTotal(items: CartItem[], discountAmount: number): number {
  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0);
  return Math.max(0, subtotal - discountAmount);
}
```

**Reducer Composition:**
```typescript
// state/index.ts
import { ActionReducerMap } from '@ngrx/store';
import { userReducer } from './user.reducer';
import { productReducer } from './product.reducer';
import { cartReducer } from './cart.reducer';

export interface AppState {
  users: UserState;
  products: ProductState;
  cart: CartState;
}

export const reducers: ActionReducerMap<AppState> = {
  users: userReducer,
  products: productReducer,
  cart: cartReducer
};
```

### Q5: How do you handle side effects with NgRx Effects?

**Answer:**
Effects handle side effects like HTTP requests, routing, and other asynchronous operations.

**Basic Effects:**
```typescript
// state/user.effects.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { map, mergeMap, catchError, switchMap, exhaustMap } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service';
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';

@Injectable()
export class UserEffects {
  
  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private userService: UserService
  ) {}
  
  // Load Users Effect
  loadUsers$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.loadUsers),
      switchMap(() =>
        this.userService.getUsers().pipe(
          map(users => UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users })),
          catchError(error => of(UserActions.loadUsersFailure({ 
            error: error.message 
          })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
  
  // Create User Effect
  createUser$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.createUser),
      exhaustMap(action =>
        this.userService.createUser(action.user).pipe(
          map(user => UserActions.createUserSuccess({ user })),
          catchError(error => of(UserActions.createUserFailure({ 
            error: error.message 
          })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
  
  // Update User Effect
  updateUser$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.updateUser),
      mergeMap(action =>
        this.userService.updateUser(action.id, action.changes).pipe(
          map(user => UserActions.updateUserSuccess({ user })),
          catchError(error => of(UserActions.updateUserFailure({ 
            error: error.message 
          })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
  
  // Delete User Effect
  deleteUser$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.deleteUser),
      mergeMap(action =>
        this.userService.deleteUser(action.id).pipe(
          map(() => UserActions.deleteUserSuccess({ id: action.id })),
          catchError(error => of(UserActions.deleteUserFailure({ 
            error: error.message 
          })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
}
```

**Advanced Effects Patterns:**
```typescript
// Advanced effects with multiple actions and complex logic
@Injectable()
export class AdvancedUserEffects {
  
  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private userService: UserService,
    private notificationService: NotificationService,
    private router: Router,
    private store: Store
  ) {}
  
  // Effect that triggers multiple actions
  createUserSuccess$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.createUserSuccess),
      map(action => {
        this.notificationService.showSuccess('User created successfully!');
        return UserActions.loadUsers(); // Reload users list
      })
    )
  );
  
  // Non-dispatching effect (for side effects only)
  navigateAfterUserCreation$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.createUserSuccess),
      tap(action => {
        this.router.navigate(['/users', action.user.id]);
      })
    ),
    { dispatch: false }
  );
  
  // Effect with state access
  loadUserIfNotExists$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.selectUser),
      withLatestFrom(this.store.select(selectAllUsers)),
      filter(([action, users]) => {
        const userExists = users.some(user => user.id === action.user?.id);
        return action.user && !userExists;
      }),
      map(([action]) => UserActions.loadUser({ id: action.user!.id }))
    )
  );
  
  // Effect with debouncing for search
  searchUsers$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.searchUsers),
      debounceTime(300),
      distinctUntilChanged((prev, curr) => prev.query === curr.query),
      switchMap(action =>
        this.userService.searchUsers(action.query).pipe(
          map(users => UserActions.searchUsersSuccess({ users })),
          catchError(error => of(UserActions.searchUsersFailure({ 
            error: error.message 
          })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
  
  // Effect with retry logic
  loadUsersWithRetry$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.loadUsers),
      switchMap(() =>
        this.userService.getUsers().pipe(
          retry(3),
          map(users => UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users })),
          catchError(error => {
            console.error('Failed to load users after 3 retries:', error);
            return of(UserActions.loadUsersFailure({ 
              error: 'Failed to load users. Please try again.' 
            }));
          })
        )
      )
    )
  );
  
  // Effect that handles optimistic updates
  optimisticUpdateUser$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.updateUserOptimistic),
      mergeMap(action => {
        // First dispatch optimistic update
        this.store.dispatch(UserActions.updateUserOptimisticSuccess({ 
          id: action.id, 
          changes: action.changes 
        }));
        
        // Then make API call
        return this.userService.updateUser(action.id, action.changes).pipe(
          map(user => UserActions.updateUserConfirmed({ user })),
          catchError(error => {
            // Revert optimistic update on error
            return of(UserActions.updateUserOptimisticFailure({ 
              id: action.id, 
              error: error.message 
            }));
          })
        );
      })
    )
  );
}
```

**Effect Testing:**
```typescript
// user.effects.spec.ts
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { provideMockActions } from '@ngrx/effects/testing';
import { Observable, of, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { UserEffects } from './user.effects';
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service';
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';

describe('UserEffects', () => {
  let actions$: Observable<any>;
  let effects: UserEffects;
  let userService: jasmine.SpyObj<UserService>;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    const spy = jasmine.createSpyObj('UserService', ['getUsers', 'createUser']);
    
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      providers: [
        UserEffects,
        provideMockActions(() => actions$),
        { provide: UserService, useValue: spy }
      ]
    });
    
    effects = TestBed.inject(UserEffects);
    userService = TestBed.inject(UserService) as jasmine.SpyObj<UserService>;
  });
  
  describe('loadUsers$', () => {
    it('should return loadUsersSuccess action on success', () => {
      const users = [{ id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com', role: 'user' }];
      const action = UserActions.loadUsers();
      const outcome = UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users });
      
      actions$ = of(action);
      userService.getUsers.and.returnValue(of(users));
      
      effects.loadUsers$.subscribe(result => {
        expect(result).toEqual(outcome);
      });
    });
    
    it('should return loadUsersFailure action on error', () => {
      const error = new Error('API Error');
      const action = UserActions.loadUsers();
      const outcome = UserActions.loadUsersFailure({ error: error.message });
      
      actions$ = of(action);
      userService.getUsers.and.returnValue(throwError(error));
      
      effects.loadUsers$.subscribe(result => {
        expect(result).toEqual(outcome);
      });
    });
  });
});
```

### Q6: How do you create and use selectors in NgRx?

**Answer:**
Selectors are pure functions used to obtain slices of store state and compute derived data.

**Basic Selectors:**
```typescript
// state/user.selectors.ts
import { createSelector, createFeatureSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
import { UserState } from './user.state';
import { AppState } from './app.state';

// Feature selector
export const selectUserState = createFeatureSelector<UserState>('users');

// Basic selectors
export const selectAllUsers = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  (state: UserState) => state.users
);

export const selectUsersLoading = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  (state: UserState) => state.loading
);

export const selectUsersError = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  (state: UserState) => state.error
);

export const selectSelectedUser = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  (state: UserState) => state.selectedUser
);

// Parameterized selector
export const selectUserById = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[], props: { id: string }) => 
    users.find(user => user.id === props.id)
);

// Computed selectors
export const selectUserCount = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[]) => users.length
);

export const selectAdminUsers = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[]) => users.filter(user => user.role === 'admin')
);

export const selectRegularUsers = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[]) => users.filter(user => user.role === 'user')
);

// Complex computed selector
export const selectUserStatistics = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[]) => {
    const total = users.length;
    const admins = users.filter(user => user.role === 'admin').length;
    const regularUsers = users.filter(user => user.role === 'user').length;
    
    return {
      total,
      admins,
      regularUsers,
      adminPercentage: total > 0 ? (admins / total) * 100 : 0
    };
  }
);
```

**Advanced Selectors:**
```typescript
// Combining multiple feature selectors
export const selectProductState = createFeatureSelector<ProductState>('products');
export const selectCartState = createFeatureSelector<CartState>('cart');

export const selectAllProducts = createSelector(
  selectProductState,
  (state: ProductState) => state.products
);

export const selectCartItems = createSelector(
  selectCartState,
  (state: CartState) => state.items
);

// Selector combining multiple states
export const selectCartWithProductDetails = createSelector(
  selectCartItems,
  selectAllProducts,
  (cartItems, products) => {
    return cartItems.map(item => {
      const product = products.find(p => p.id === item.productId);
      return {
        ...item,
        productName: product?.name || 'Unknown Product',
        productImage: product?.image || '',
        totalPrice: item.quantity * item.price
      };
    });
  }
);

// Memoized selector with complex computation
export const selectUserSearchResults = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[], props: { query: string; filters: UserFilters }) => {
    const { query, filters } = props;
    
    return users
      .filter(user => {
        // Text search
        const matchesQuery = !query || 
          user.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
          user.email.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase());
        
        // Role filter
        const matchesRole = !filters.role || user.role === filters.role;
        
        // Date filter
        const matchesDateRange = !filters.dateRange || 
          (new Date(user.createdAt) >= filters.dateRange.start &&
           new Date(user.createdAt) <= filters.dateRange.end);
        
        return matchesQuery && matchesRole && matchesDateRange;
      })
      .sort((a, b) => {
        // Sort by relevance
        if (query) {
          const aScore = calculateRelevanceScore(a, query);
          const bScore = calculateRelevanceScore(b, query);
          return bScore - aScore;
        }
        return a.name.localeCompare(b.name);
      });
  }
);

function calculateRelevanceScore(user: User, query: string): number {
  const lowerQuery = query.toLowerCase();
  let score = 0;
  
  if (user.name.toLowerCase().startsWith(lowerQuery)) score += 10;
  if (user.name.toLowerCase().includes(lowerQuery)) score += 5;
  if (user.email.toLowerCase().includes(lowerQuery)) score += 3;
  
  return score;
}
```

**Using Selectors in Components:**
```typescript
// user-list.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import * as UserSelectors from '../state/user.selectors';
import * as UserActions from '../state/user.actions';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-list',
  template: `
    <div>
      <h2>Users ({{ userCount$ | async }})</h2>
      
      <div *ngIf="loading$ | async">Loading...</div>
      <div *ngIf="error$ | async as error" class="error">{{ error }}</div>
      
      <div class="user-stats">
        <ng-container *ngIf="userStats$ | async as stats">
          <p>Total: {{ stats.total }}</p>
          <p>Admins: {{ stats.admins }} ({{ stats.adminPercentage | number:'1.1-1' }}%)</p>
          <p>Regular Users: {{ stats.regularUsers }}</p>
        </ng-container>
      </div>
      
      <div class="user-list">
        <div *ngFor="let user of users$ | async" 
             class="user-card"
             [class.selected]="(selectedUser$ | async)?.id === user.id"
             (click)="selectUser(user)">
          <h3>{{ user.name }}</h3>
          <p>{{ user.email }}</p>
          <span class="role">{{ user.role }}</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="admin-section">
        <h3>Admin Users</h3>
        <div *ngFor="let admin of adminUsers$ | async">
          {{ admin.name }} - {{ admin.email }}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  `
})
export class UserListComponent implements OnInit {
  users$ = this.store.select(UserSelectors.selectAllUsers);
  loading$ = this.store.select(UserSelectors.selectUsersLoading);
  error$ = this.store.select(UserSelectors.selectUsersError);
  selectedUser$ = this.store.select(UserSelectors.selectSelectedUser);
  userCount$ = this.store.select(UserSelectors.selectUserCount);
  userStats$ = this.store.select(UserSelectors.selectUserStatistics);
  adminUsers$ = this.store.select(UserSelectors.selectAdminUsers);
  
  constructor(private store: Store) {}
  
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.loadUsers());
  }
  
  selectUser(user: User): void {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.selectUser({ user }));
  }
}
```

**Selector Performance Optimization:**
```typescript
// Using memoization for expensive computations
export const selectExpensiveComputation = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  selectAllProducts,
  (users, products) => {
    // This will only recompute when users or products change
    return users.map(user => {
      const userProducts = products.filter(p => p.ownerId === user.id);
      return {
        ...user,
        productCount: userProducts.length,
        totalProductValue: userProducts.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.price, 0)
      };
    });
  }
);

// Selector with custom equality function
export const selectUsersSortedByName = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users) => [...users].sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name)),
  {
    // Custom memoization - only recompute if array length or any name changes
    memoizeOptions: {
      resultEqualityCheck: (a, b) => 
        a.length === b.length && 
        a.every((user, index) => user.name === b[index].name)
    }
  }
);
```

### Q7: How do you implement advanced NgRx patterns for complex state management?

**Answer:**
Advanced NgRx patterns help manage complex state scenarios, including nested entities, optimistic updates, and real-time synchronization.

**Feature State Composition:**
```typescript
// Feature State Composition with Multiple Entities
import { createFeatureSelector, createSelector, combineReducers } from '@ngrx/store';
import { EntityState, EntityAdapter, createEntityAdapter } from '@ngrx/entity';

// User Entity State
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  roleId: string;
  departmentId: string;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  language: string;
  notifications: NotificationSettings;
}

interface NotificationSettings {
  email: boolean;
  push: boolean;
  sms: boolean;
}

interface UserState extends EntityState<User> {
  selectedUserId: string | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  filters: UserFilters;
  pagination: PaginationState;
}

interface UserFilters {
  search: string;
  role: string | null;
  department: string | null;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'all';
}

interface PaginationState {
  page: number;
  pageSize: number;
  total: number;
}

// Role Entity State
interface Role {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  description: string;
}

interface Permission {
  id: string;
  resource: string;
  actions: string[];
}

interface RoleState extends EntityState<Role> {
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

// Department Entity State
interface Department {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  managerId: string;
  parentId: string | null;
  children: string[];
}

interface DepartmentState extends EntityState<Department> {
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  hierarchy: DepartmentHierarchy[];
}

interface DepartmentHierarchy {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  level: number;
  children: DepartmentHierarchy[];
}

// Combined Feature State
interface UserManagementState {
  users: UserState;
  roles: RoleState;
  departments: DepartmentState;
  ui: UserManagementUIState;
}

interface UserManagementUIState {
  activeTab: 'users' | 'roles' | 'departments';
  sidebarOpen: boolean;
  bulkActions: {
    selectedIds: string[];
    action: string | null;
    inProgress: boolean;

### Q8: How do you implement real-time state synchronization with NgRx?

**Answer:**
Real-time state synchronization requires WebSocket integration, conflict resolution, and optimistic updates with server reconciliation.

**Real-time State Synchronization:**
```typescript
// Real-time State Actions
const connectWebSocket = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Connect',
  props<{ url: string }>()
);

const webSocketConnected = createAction('[WebSocket] Connected');
const webSocketDisconnected = createAction('[WebSocket] Disconnected');
const webSocketError = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Error',
  props<{ error: string }>()
);

const receiveRealTimeUpdate = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Receive Update',
  props<{ 
    type: string;
    payload: any;
    timestamp: number;
    source: string;
  }>()
);

const sendRealTimeUpdate = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Send Update',
  props<{ 
    type: string;
    payload: any;
  }>()
);

// Real-time State Interface
interface RealTimeState {
  connected: boolean;
  connecting: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  lastUpdate: number;
  pendingUpdates: PendingUpdate[];
  conflictResolution: ConflictResolutionState;
}

interface PendingUpdate {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  payload: any;
  timestamp: number;
  retryCount: number;
  maxRetries: number;
}

interface ConflictResolutionState {
  conflicts: Conflict[];
  resolutionStrategy: 'client-wins' | 'server-wins' | 'merge' | 'manual';
}

interface Conflict {
  id: string;
  entityType: string;
  entityId: string;
  clientVersion: any;

### Q9: How do you implement advanced NgRx patterns for enterprise applications?

**Answer:**
Enterprise NgRx applications require sophisticated patterns for scalability, maintainability, and performance optimization.

### Q10: How do you implement NgRx with micro-frontend architecture?

**Answer:**
Integrating NgRx with micro-frontend architecture requires careful state isolation, cross-application communication, and shared state management strategies.

**Micro-frontend NgRx Architecture:**
```typescript
// Shared State Interface
interface SharedAppState {
  user: UserState;
  theme: ThemeState;
  notifications: NotificationState;
}

### Q11: How do you implement NgRx with Angular 15+ Standalone Components and modern architecture?

**Answer:**
Implementing NgRx with Angular 15+ standalone components requires adapting state management patterns to work without NgModules while maintaining type safety and performance.

**Standalone Component Store Setup:**
```typescript
// standalone-store.config.ts
import { provideStore, provideState } from '@ngrx/store';
import { provideEffects } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { provideStoreDevtools } from '@ngrx/store-devtools';
import { provideRouterStore } from '@ngrx/router-store';
import { isDevMode } from '@angular/core';

// Feature state interfaces
interface UserState {
  users: User[];
  selectedUser: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

interface ProductState {
  products: Product[];
  filters: ProductFilters;
  pagination: PaginationState;
  cache: Map<string, Product[]>;
}

// Root state
interface AppState {
  users: UserState;
  products: ProductState;
  router: RouterReducerState;
}

// Store providers for standalone bootstrap
export const storeProviders = [
  provideStore({
    users: userReducer,
    products: productReducer
  }),
  provideEffects([UserEffects, ProductEffects, RouterEffects]),
  provideRouterStore(),
  provideStoreDevtools({
    maxAge: 25,
    logOnly: !isDevMode(),
    autoPause: true,
    trace: false,
    traceLimit: 75
  })
];

// Feature store providers
export const featureStoreProviders = [
  provideState('analytics', analyticsReducer),
  provideEffects([AnalyticsEffects])
];
```

**Standalone Component Integration:**
```typescript
// user-management.component.ts
import { Component, inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-management',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, ReactiveFormsModule],
  template: `
    <div class="user-management">
      <div class="user-list">
        <div *ngFor="let user of users$ | async; trackBy: trackByUserId" 
             class="user-card"
             [class.selected]="(selectedUser$ | async)?.id === user.id"
             (click)="selectUser(user)">
          <h3>{{ user.name }}</h3>

                    class="danger">
              Delete
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="user-details" *ngIf="selectedUser$ | async as user">
        <h2>User Details</h2>
        <form [formGroup]="userForm" (ngSubmit)="updateUser()">
          <input formControlName="name" placeholder="Name">
          <input formControlName="email" placeholder="Email">
          <button type="submit" [disabled]="userForm.invalid || (loading$ | async)">
            {{ (loading$ | async) ? 'Updating...' : 'Update User' }}

})
export class UserManagementComponent implements OnInit {

  // Selectors with type safety
  users$ = this.store.select(selectAllUsers);
  selectedUser$ = this.store.select(selectSelectedUser);
  loading$ = this.store.select(selectUsersLoading);
  error$ = this.store.select(selectUsersError);
  
  userForm = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(2)]],
    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]]
  });
  
  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {}
  
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.loadUsers());
    
    // Subscribe to selected user changes
    this.selectedUser$.pipe(
      filter(user => !!user),
      takeUntilDestroyed()
    ).subscribe(user => {
      this.userForm.patchValue({
        name: user!.name,
        email: user!.email
      });
    });
  }

  updateUser(): void {
    if (this.userForm.valid) {
      const formValue = this.userForm.value;
      this.store.dispatch(UserActions.updateUser({

          ...formValue,
          id: this.selectedUser$.pipe(take(1)).subscribe(user => user?.id)

      }));
    }
  }
  
  trackByUserId(index: number, user: User): string {
    return user.id;
  }
}
```

**Advanced Selectors with Memoization:**
```typescript
// user.selectors.ts
import { createSelector, createFeatureSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
import { UserState } from './user.reducer';

// Feature selector
export const selectUserState = createFeatureSelector<UserState>('users');

// Basic selectors
export const selectAllUsers = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  (state: UserState) => state.users
);

export const selectUsersLoading = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  (state: UserState) => state.loading
);

export const selectUsersError = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  (state: UserState) => state.error
);

export const selectSelectedUser = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  (state: UserState) => state.selectedUser
);

// Advanced computed selectors
export const selectUserById = (userId: string) => createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[]) => users.find(user => user.id === userId)
);

export const selectActiveUsers = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[]) => users.filter(user => user.isActive)
);

export const selectUsersByRole = (role: UserRole) => createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[]) => users.filter(user => user.role === role)
);

export const selectUsersWithPagination = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  selectUserState,
  (users: User[], state: UserState) => {
    const { page, pageSize } = state.pagination;
    const startIndex = (page - 1) * pageSize;
    const endIndex = startIndex + pageSize;
    
    return {
      users: users.slice(startIndex, endIndex),
      totalUsers: users.length,
      currentPage: page,
      totalPages: Math.ceil(users.length / pageSize),
      hasNextPage: endIndex < users.length,
      hasPreviousPage: page > 1
    };
  }
);

// Complex business logic selectors
export const selectUserStatistics = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[]) => {
    const totalUsers = users.length;
    const activeUsers = users.filter(u => u.isActive).length;
    const usersByRole = users.reduce((acc, user) => {
      acc[user.role] = (acc[user.role] || 0) + 1;
      return acc;
    }, {} as Record<UserRole, number>);
    
    return {
      totalUsers,
      activeUsers,
      inactiveUsers: totalUsers - activeUsers,
      usersByRole,
      averageAge: users.reduce((sum, u) => sum + u.age, 0) / totalUsers
    };
  }
);
```

**Component Store for Local State:**
```typescript
// user-form.component-store.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { ComponentStore } from '@ngrx/component-store';
import { Observable, switchMap, tap, catchError, EMPTY } from 'rxjs';

interface UserFormState {
  user: Partial<User>;
  isEditing: boolean;
  isDirty: boolean;
  validationErrors: Record<string, string[]>;
  isSubmitting: boolean;
}

const initialState: UserFormState = {
  user: {},
  isEditing: false,
  isDirty: false,
  validationErrors: {},
  isSubmitting: false
};

@Injectable()
export class UserFormComponentStore extends ComponentStore<UserFormState> {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {
    super(initialState);
  }
  
  // Selectors
  readonly user$ = this.select(state => state.user);
  readonly isEditing$ = this.select(state => state.isEditing);
  readonly isDirty$ = this.select(state => state.isDirty);
  readonly validationErrors$ = this.select(state => state.validationErrors);
  readonly isSubmitting$ = this.select(state => state.isSubmitting);
  
  readonly canSave$ = this.select(
    this.isDirty$,
    this.validationErrors$,
    this.isSubmitting$,
    (isDirty, errors, isSubmitting) => 
      isDirty && Object.keys(errors).length === 0 && !isSubmitting
  );
  
  // Updaters
  readonly setUser = this.updater((state, user: Partial<User>) => ({
    ...state,
    user: { ...state.user, ...user },
    isDirty: true
  }));
  
  readonly setEditing = this.updater((state, isEditing: boolean) => ({
    ...state,
    isEditing
  }));
  
  readonly setValidationErrors = this.updater(
    (state, errors: Record<string, string[]>) => ({
      ...state,
      validationErrors: errors
    })
  );
  
  readonly resetForm = this.updater((state) => ({
    ...initialState,
    user: state.user
  }));
  
  // Effects
  readonly saveUser = this.effect((user$: Observable<User>) => {
    return user$.pipe(
      tap(() => this.patchState({ isSubmitting: true })),
      switchMap((user) => 
        this.userService.saveUser(user).pipe(
          tap((savedUser) => {
            this.patchState({ 
              user: savedUser, 
              isDirty: false, 
              isSubmitting: false,
              isEditing: false
            });
          }),
          catchError((error) => {
            this.patchState({ 
              isSubmitting: false,
              validationErrors: this.parseValidationErrors(error)
            });
            return EMPTY;
          })
        )
      )
    );
  });
  
  private parseValidationErrors(error: any): Record<string, string[]> {
    // Parse server validation errors
    return error.validationErrors || {};
  }
}
```

### Q12: How do you implement advanced NgRx testing strategies with modern Angular testing utilities?

**Answer:**
Advanced NgRx testing requires comprehensive strategies for testing actions, reducers, effects, selectors, and component integration with modern Angular testing utilities.

**Testing Actions:**
```typescript
// user.actions.spec.ts
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

describe('User Actions', () => {
  const mockUser: User = {
    id: '1',
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    role: 'admin',
    isActive: true,
    age: 30
  };
  
  describe('loadUsers', () => {
    it('should create an action', () => {
      const action = UserActions.loadUsers();
      expect(action.type).toBe('[User] Load Users');
    });
  });
  
  describe('loadUsersSuccess', () => {
    it('should create an action with users payload', () => {
      const users = [mockUser];
      const action = UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users });
      
      expect(action.type).toBe('[User] Load Users Success');
      expect(action.users).toEqual(users);
    });
  });
  
  describe('updateUser', () => {
    it('should create an action with user payload', () => {
      const action = UserActions.updateUser({ user: mockUser });
      
      expect(action.type).toBe('[User] Update User');
      expect(action.user).toEqual(mockUser);
    });
  });
});
```

**Testing Reducers:**
```typescript
// user.reducer.spec.ts
import { userReducer, initialState, UserState } from './user.reducer';
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

describe('User Reducer', () => {
  const mockUsers: User[] = [
    { id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@test.com', role: 'admin', isActive: true, age: 30 },
    { id: '2', name: 'Jane', email: 'jane@test.com', role: 'user', isActive: true, age: 25 }
  ];
  
  describe('unknown action', () => {
    it('should return the previous state', () => {
      const action = {} as any;
      const result = userReducer(initialState, action);
      
      expect(result).toBe(initialState);
    });
  });
  
  describe('loadUsers action', () => {
    it('should set loading to true', () => {
      const action = UserActions.loadUsers();
      const result = userReducer(initialState, action);
      
      expect(result.loading).toBe(true);
      expect(result.error).toBe(null);
    });
  });
  
  describe('loadUsersSuccess action', () => {
    it('should populate users and set loading to false', () => {
      const action = UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users: mockUsers });
      const result = userReducer(initialState, action);
      
      expect(result.users).toEqual(mockUsers);
      expect(result.loading).toBe(false);
      expect(result.error).toBe(null);
    });
  });
  
  describe('updateUserSuccess action', () => {
    it('should update existing user', () => {
      const stateWithUsers: UserState = {
        ...initialState,
        users: mockUsers
      };
      
      const updatedUser = { ...mockUsers[0], name: 'John Updated' };
      const action = UserActions.updateUserSuccess({ user: updatedUser });
      const result = userReducer(stateWithUsers, action);
      
      expect(result.users[0]).toEqual(updatedUser);
      expect(result.users[1]).toEqual(mockUsers[1]);
    });
  });
  
  describe('deleteUserSuccess action', () => {
    it('should remove user from state', () => {
      const stateWithUsers: UserState = {
        ...initialState,
        users: mockUsers
      };
      
      const action = UserActions.deleteUserSuccess({ userId: '1' });
      const result = userReducer(stateWithUsers, action);
      
      expect(result.users).toHaveLength(1);
      expect(result.users[0].id).toBe('2');
    });
  });
});
```

**Testing Effects:**
```typescript
// user.effects.spec.ts
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { provideMockActions } from '@ngrx/effects/testing';
import { Observable, of, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { Action } from '@ngrx/store';
import { UserEffects } from './user.effects';
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service';
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';
import { hot, cold } from 'jasmine-marbles';

describe('UserEffects', () => {
  let actions$: Observable<Action>;
  let effects: UserEffects;
  let userService: jasmine.SpyObj<UserService>;
  
  const mockUsers = [
    { id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@test.com', role: 'admin', isActive: true, age: 30 }
  ];
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    const spy = jasmine.createSpyObj('UserService', [
      'getUsers', 'createUser', 'updateUser', 'deleteUser'
    ]);
    
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      providers: [
        UserEffects,
        provideMockActions(() => actions$),
        { provide: UserService, useValue: spy }
      ]
    });
    
    effects = TestBed.inject(UserEffects);
    userService = TestBed.inject(UserService) as jasmine.SpyObj<UserService>;
  });
  
  describe('loadUsers$', () => {
    it('should return loadUsersSuccess action on successful API call', () => {
      const action = UserActions.loadUsers();
      const completion = UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users: mockUsers });
      
      actions$ = hot('-a', { a: action });
      const response = cold('-a|', { a: mockUsers });
      userService.getUsers.and.returnValue(response);
      
      const expected = cold('--b', { b: completion });
      expect(effects.loadUsers$).toBeObservable(expected);
    });
    
    it('should return loadUsersFailure action on API error', () => {
      const action = UserActions.loadUsers();
      const error = new Error('API Error');
      const completion = UserActions.loadUsersFailure({ error: error.message });
      
      actions$ = hot('-a', { a: action });
      const response = cold('-#|', {}, error);
      userService.getUsers.and.returnValue(response);
      
      const expected = cold('--b', { b: completion });
      expect(effects.loadUsers$).toBeObservable(expected);
    });
  });
  
  describe('createUser$', () => {
    it('should return createUserSuccess and show success message', () => {
      const user = mockUsers[0];
      const action = UserActions.createUser({ user });
      const completion = UserActions.createUserSuccess({ user });
      
      actions$ = hot('-a', { a: action });
      const response = cold('-a|', { a: user });
      userService.createUser.and.returnValue(response);
      
      const expected = cold('--b', { b: completion });
      expect(effects.createUser$).toBeObservable(expected);
    });
  });
});
```

**Testing Selectors:**
```typescript
// user.selectors.spec.ts
import * as UserSelectors from './user.selectors';
import { UserState } from './user.reducer';
import { AppState } from '../app.state';

describe('User Selectors', () => {
  const mockUsers = [
    { id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@test.com', role: 'admin', isActive: true, age: 30 },
    { id: '2', name: 'Jane', email: 'jane@test.com', role: 'user', isActive: false, age: 25 },
    { id: '3', name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@test.com', role: 'user', isActive: true, age: 35 }
  ];
  
  const userState: UserState = {
    users: mockUsers,
    selectedUser: mockUsers[0],
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    pagination: { page: 1, pageSize: 10 }
  };
  
  const appState: AppState = {
    users: userState,
    products: {} as any,
    router: {} as any
  };
  
  describe('selectAllUsers', () => {
    it('should select all users', () => {
      const result = UserSelectors.selectAllUsers(appState);
      expect(result).toEqual(mockUsers);
    });
  });
  
  describe('selectActiveUsers', () => {
    it('should select only active users', () => {
      const result = UserSelectors.selectActiveUsers(appState);
      expect(result).toHaveLength(2);
      expect(result.every(user => user.isActive)).toBe(true);
    });
  });
  
  describe('selectUserById', () => {
    it('should select user by id', () => {
      const result = UserSelectors.selectUserById('1')(appState);
      expect(result).toEqual(mockUsers[0]);
    });
    
    it('should return undefined for non-existent user', () => {
      const result = UserSelectors.selectUserById('999')(appState);
      expect(result).toBeUndefined();

      expect(result.usersByRole.user).toBe(2);
      expect(result.averageAge).toBe(30);
    });
  });
});
```

**Integration Testing with Components:**
```typescript
// user-management.component.spec.ts
import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { MockStore, provideMockStore } from '@ngrx/store/testing';
import { UserManagementComponent } from './user-management.component';
import * as UserActions from '../store/user.actions';
import * as UserSelectors from '../store/user.selectors';
import { AppState } from '../store/app.state';
import { DebugElement } from '@angular/core';
import { By } from '@angular/platform-browser';

describe('UserManagementComponent', () => {
  let component: UserManagementComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<UserManagementComponent>;
  let store: MockStore;

### Q13: How would you implement NgRx Signal Store for modern Angular applications?

**Answer:**
NgRx Signal Store is a modern state management solution that leverages Angular's Signals API for reactive state management with reduced boilerplate compared to traditional NgRx.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Signal-Based State Management:**
```typescript
// Setting up a Signal Store
import { signalStore, withState, withMethods, withComputed, patchState } from '@ngrx/signals';
import { computed, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { rxMethod } from '@ngrx/signals/rxjs-interop';
import { pipe, switchMap, map, tap } from 'rxjs';

// Define state interface
interface ProductsState {
  products: Product[];
  selectedProductId: string | null;
  status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'error';
  error: string | null;
}

// Create the store
export const ProductsStore = signalStore(
  // Initial state
  withState<ProductsState>({
    products: [],
    selectedProductId: null,
    status: 'idle',
    error: null
  }),
  
  // Computed values
  withComputed((state) => ({
    selectedProduct: computed(() => {
      const selectedId = state.selectedProductId();
      return selectedId ? state.products().find(p => p.id === selectedId) : null;
    }),
    productCount: computed(() => state.products().length),
    isLoading: computed(() => state.status() === 'loading')
  })),
  
  // Methods
  withMethods((state, productsService = inject(ProductsService)) => ({
    // Synchronous method
    selectProduct(productId: string) {
      patchState(state, { selectedProductId: productId });
    },
    
    // Asynchronous method using rxMethod
    loadProducts: rxMethod<void>(pipe(
      tap(() => patchState(state, { status: 'loading' })),
      switchMap(() => productsService.getProducts().pipe(
        map(products => {
          patchState(state, { 
            products, 
            status: 'loaded',
            error: null 
          });
        }),
        tap({
          error: (err) => patchState(state, { 
            status: 'error', 
            error: err.message 
          })
        })
      ))
    ))
  }))
);
```

2. **Using Signal Store in Components:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-products',
  template: `
    <div *ngIf="store.isLoading()" class="loading">Loading...</div>
    
    <div *ngIf="store.status() === 'error'" class="error">
      Error: {{ store.error() }}
    </div>
    
    <div *ngIf="store.status() === 'loaded'">
      <h2>Products ({{ store.productCount() }})</h2>
      
      <div class="product-list">
        <div 
          *ngFor="let product of store.products()"
          class="product-card"
          [class.selected]="product.id === store.selectedProductId()"
          (click)="store.selectProduct(product.id)">
          {{ product.name }} - ${{ product.price }}
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div *ngIf="store.selectedProduct()" class="product-details">
        <h3>{{ store.selectedProduct()?.name }}</h3>
        <p>{{ store.selectedProduct()?.description }}</p>
        <p class="price">${{ store.selectedProduct()?.price }}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  providers: [ProductsStore]
})
export class ProductsComponent implements OnInit {
  store = inject(ProductsStore);
  
  ngOnInit() {
    this.store.loadProducts();
  }
}
```

3. **Benefits of Signal Store:**
   - Reduced boilerplate compared to traditional NgRx
   - Leverages Angular's built-in Signals API
   - Improved performance with fine-grained reactivity
   - Better TypeScript support and type inference
   - Simpler testing with fewer abstractions
   - Seamless integration with standalone components

4. **Migration Strategy from Traditional NgRx:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Identify a feature module using traditional NgRx
// Step 2: Create equivalent Signal Store
// Step 3: Replace selectors with computed signals
// Step 4: Replace effects with rxMethods
// Step 5: Replace action dispatching with direct method calls

// Example migration of a selector
// Before: Traditional NgRx
const selectProducts = createSelector(
  selectProductState,
  (state) => state.products
);

// After: Signal Store
const products = computed(() => state.products());

// Example migration of an effect
// Before: Traditional NgRx
loadProducts$ = createEffect(() => 
  this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType(ProductActions.load),
    switchMap(() => this.productService.getAll().pipe(
      map(products => ProductActions.loadSuccess({ products })),
      catchError(error => of(ProductActions.loadFailure({ error })))
    ))
  )
);

// After: Signal Store
loadProducts: rxMethod<void>(pipe(
  tap(() => patchState(state, { status: 'loading' })),
  switchMap(() => this.productService.getAll().pipe(
    map(products => patchState(state, { products, status: 'loaded' })),
    catchError(error => of(patchState(state, { error, status: 'error' })))
  ))
))
```

### Q14: How would you implement advanced NgRx patterns for enterprise applications?

**Answer:**
Enterprise applications require sophisticated state management patterns to handle complex domains, scale effectively, and maintain performance.

**Advanced NgRx Patterns:**

1. **Domain-Driven State Composition:**
```typescript
// Core state interfaces organized by domain
export interface AppState {
  auth: AuthState;
  products: ProductsState;
  orders: OrdersState;
  customers: CustomersState;
  ui: UiState;
}

// Feature state with normalized entities
export interface ProductsState {
  entities: Record<string, Product>;
  ids: string[];
  selectedId: string | null;
  filters: ProductFilters;
  pagination: PaginationState;
  loadingStatus: LoadingStatus;
  error: ErrorState | null;
}

// Root store module with lazy-loaded feature states
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, {
      metaReducers,
      runtimeChecks: {
        strictStateImmutability: true,
        strictActionImmutability: true,
        strictStateSerializability: true,
        strictActionSerializability: true,
        strictActionWithinNgZone: true,
        strictActionTypeUniqueness: true,
      },
    }),
    EffectsModule.forRoot([CoreEffects]),
    StoreRouterConnectingModule.forRoot(),
    StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({
      maxAge: 25,
      logOnly: environment.production,
      autoPause: true,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppStoreModule {}
```

2. **Advanced Optimistic Updates with Conflict Resolution:**
```typescript
// Action creators for optimistic updates
const updateProductOptimistic = createAction(
  '[Product] Update Optimistic',
  props<{ product: Product; originalProduct: Product }>()
);

const updateProductSuccess = createAction(
  '[Product] Update Success',
  props<{ product: Product }>()
);

const updateProductFailure = createAction(
  '[Product] Update Failure',
  props<{ error: any; originalProduct: Product }>()
);

// Reducer handling optimistic updates
const productReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(updateProductOptimistic, (state, { product }) => {
    return adapter.updateOne(
      { id: product.id, changes: product },
      { ...state, pendingUpdates: [...state.pendingUpdates, product.id] }
    );
  }),
  on(updateProductSuccess, (state, { product }) => {
    return {
      ...adapter.updateOne({ id: product.id, changes: product }, state),
      pendingUpdates: state.pendingUpdates.filter(id => id !== product.id),
      lastSyncedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }),
  on(updateProductFailure, (state, { originalProduct, error }) => {
    return {
      ...adapter.updateOne(
        { id: originalProduct.id, changes: originalProduct },
        state
      ),
      pendingUpdates: state.pendingUpdates.filter(id => id !== originalProduct.id),
      errors: [...state.errors, { entityId: originalProduct.id, error }]
    };
  })
);

// Effect for handling optimistic updates with conflict resolution
@Injectable()
export class ProductEffects {
  updateProduct$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(updateProductOptimistic),
      concatMap(({ product, originalProduct }) =>
        this.productService.update(product).pipe(
          map(updatedProduct => {
            // Check for conflicts (server might have newer version)
            if (updatedProduct.version !== product.version) {
              // Handle conflict - could show UI for conflict resolution
              this.conflictService.handleConflict({
                clientVersion: product,
                serverVersion: updatedProduct
              });
            }
            return updateProductSuccess({ product: updatedProduct });
          }),
          catchError(error => of(updateProductFailure({ 
            error, 
            originalProduct 
          })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
}
```

3. **Real-time State Synchronization:**
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class RealTimeEffects {
  private readonly websocket$ = this.websocketService.connect();

  // Listen for real-time updates and dispatch actions
  syncState$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.websocket$.pipe(
      filter(event => event.type === 'ENTITY_UPDATED'),
      map(event => {
        // Determine which entity was updated
        switch (event.entityType) {
          case 'product':
            return ProductActions.externalUpdate({ product: event.data });
          case 'order':
            return OrderActions.externalUpdate({ order: event.data });
          default:
            return { type: 'UNKNOWN_ENTITY_TYPE' };
        }
      })
    )
  );

  // Handle offline/online synchronization
  syncOfflineChanges$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.networkService.online$.pipe(
      filter(online => online), // Only when coming back online
      withLatestFrom(this.store.select(selectOfflineChanges)),
      switchMap(([_, offlineChanges]) =>
        this.syncService.batchSync(offlineChanges).pipe(
          map(results => SyncActions.syncComplete({ results })),
          catchError(error => of(SyncActions.syncError({ error })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
}
```

4. **Advanced Micro-frontend State Composition:**
```typescript
// Shell application state
export interface ShellState {
  auth: AuthState;
  navigation: NavigationState;
  sharedContext: SharedContextState;
}

// Micro-frontend state registration service
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class MicroFrontendStateRegistry {
  private registry = new Map<string, ActionReducerMap<any>>();

  constructor(private store: Store) {}

  // Register a micro-frontend's state
  registerState(microFrontendId: string, reducers: ActionReducerMap<any>) {
    if (!this.registry.has(microFrontendId)) {
      // Dynamically add feature state
      this.store.dispatch({
        type: '[Store] Register Dynamic Feature',
        feature: microFrontendId,
        reducers
      });
      this.registry.set(microFrontendId, reducers);
    }
    return this.registry.get(microFrontendId);
  }

  // Unregister when micro-frontend is unmounted
  unregisterState(microFrontendId: string) {
    if (this.registry.has(microFrontendId)) {
      this.store.dispatch({
        type: '[Store] Unregister Dynamic Feature',
        feature: microFrontendId
      });
      this.registry.delete(microFrontendId);
    }
  }
}

// Custom meta-reducer for handling dynamic features
export function dynamicFeaturesMetaReducer(
  reducer: ActionReducer<any>
): ActionReducer<any> {
  const featureReducers = {};
  
  return (state, action) => {
    // Handle dynamic feature registration
    if (action.type === '[Store] Register Dynamic Feature') {
      featureReducers[action.feature] = action.reducers;
    }
    
    // Handle dynamic feature unregistration
    if (action.type === '[Store] Unregister Dynamic Feature') {
      const { [action.feature]: removed, ...remaining } = featureReducers;
      Object.assign(featureReducers, remaining);
    }
    
    // Apply the main reducer
    let newState = reducer(state, action);
    
    // Apply any dynamic feature reducers
    Object.keys(featureReducers).forEach(feature => {
      const featureReducer = combineReducers(featureReducers[feature]);
      newState = {
        ...newState,
        [feature]: featureReducer(newState[feature], action)
      };
    });
    
    return newState;
  };
}
```

5. **Performance Optimization Patterns:**
```typescript
// Memoized selectors with custom equality functions
export const selectFilteredProducts = createSelector(
  selectAllProducts,
  selectProductFilters,
  (products, filters) => {
    // Return same reference if filters haven't changed
    return products.filter(product => {
      return (!filters.category || product.category === filters.category) &&
             (!filters.minPrice || product.price >= filters.minPrice) &&
             (!filters.maxPrice || product.price <= filters.maxPrice) &&
             (!filters.searchTerm || 
               product.name.toLowerCase().includes(filters.searchTerm.toLowerCase()));
    });
  },
  {
    memoize: customMemoize,
    resultEqualityCheck: (a, b) => {
      if (a === b) return true;
      if (!a || !b) return false;
      if (a.length !== b.length) return false;
      return a.every((item, i) => item.id === b[i].id);
    }
  }
);

// Custom projection function for minimizing state changes
export const selectProductViewModel = createSelector(
  selectSelectedProduct,
  selectRelatedProducts,
  selectProductReviews,
  (product, relatedProducts, reviews) => {
    if (!product) return null;
    
    // Only include necessary fields to minimize object size
    return {
      id: product.id,
      name: product.name,
      price: product.price,
      imageUrl: product.imageUrl,
      averageRating: calculateAverageRating(reviews),
      relatedProductIds: relatedProducts.map(p => p.id)
    };
  }
);

// State hydration and rehydration for performance
export function localStorageSyncReducer(
  reducer: ActionReducer<any>
): ActionReducer<any> {
  return localStorageSync({
    keys: ['auth', 'ui.preferences'],
    rehydrate: true,
    removeOnUndefined: true,
    storageKeySerializer: (key) => `app_state_${key}`,
    syncCondition: (state) => state.auth?.isAuthenticated
  })(reducer);
}
```

This advanced NgRx guide now includes complex state composition patterns, optimistic updates with rollback capabilities, real-time state synchronization with conflict resolution strategies, enterprise-level patterns for scalability, comprehensive micro-frontend integration strategies, modern standalone component integration with Signal Store, and comprehensive testing strategies with modern Angular testing utilities.

### Q15: How do you implement comprehensive testing strategies for NgRx applications?

**Answer:**
Testing NgRx applications requires a multi-layered approach covering actions, reducers, effects, selectors, and integration scenarios.

**1. Testing Actions:**
```typescript
// user.actions.spec.ts
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

describe('User Actions', () => {
  describe('loadUsers', () => {
    it('should create an action', () => {
      const action = UserActions.loadUsers();
      expect(action.type).toBe('[User] Load Users');
    });
  });

  describe('loadUsersSuccess', () => {
    it('should create an action with users payload', () => {
      const users: User[] = [
        { id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com', role: 'user' },
        { id: '2', name: 'Jane', email: 'jane@example.com', role: 'admin' }
      ];
      const action = UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users });
      
      expect(action.type).toBe('[User] Load Users Success');
      expect(action.users).toEqual(users);
    });
  });

  describe('updateUser', () => {
    it('should create an action with user update payload', () => {
      const user: User = { id: '1', name: 'John Updated', email: 'john@example.com', role: 'user' };
      const action = UserActions.updateUser({ user });
      
      expect(action.type).toBe('[User] Update User');
      expect(action.user).toEqual(user);
    });
  });

  describe('deleteUser', () => {
    it('should create an action with user id', () => {
      const id = '123';
      const action = UserActions.deleteUser({ id });
      
      expect(action.type).toBe('[User] Delete User');
      expect(action.id).toBe(id);
    });
  });
});
```

**2. Testing Reducers:**
```typescript
// user.reducer.spec.ts
import { userReducer, initialUserState } from './user.reducer';
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

describe('User Reducer', () => {
  const mockUsers: User[] = [
    { id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com', role: 'user' },
    { id: '2', name: 'Jane', email: 'jane@example.com', role: 'admin' }
  ];

  describe('unknown action', () => {
    it('should return the previous state', () => {
      const action = {} as any;
      const result = userReducer(initialUserState, action);
      expect(result).toBe(initialUserState);
    });
  });

  describe('loadUsers action', () => {
    it('should set loading to true and clear error', () => {
      const action = UserActions.loadUsers();
      const result = userReducer(initialUserState, action);
      
      expect(result.loading).toBe(true);
      expect(result.error).toBe(null);
      expect(result.users).toEqual([]);
    });
  });

  describe('loadUsersSuccess action', () => {
    it('should populate users and set loading to false', () => {
      const action = UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users: mockUsers });
      const result = userReducer(initialUserState, action);
      
      expect(result.loading).toBe(false);
      expect(result.error).toBe(null);
      expect(result.users).toEqual(mockUsers);
    });
  });

  describe('loadUsersFailure action', () => {
    it('should set error and loading to false', () => {
      const error = 'Failed to load users';
      const action = UserActions.loadUsersFailure({ error });
      const result = userReducer(initialUserState, action);
      
      expect(result.loading).toBe(false);
      expect(result.error).toBe(error);
      expect(result.users).toEqual([]);
    });
  });

  describe('updateUser action', () => {
    it('should update existing user', () => {
      const initialState = {
        ...initialUserState,
        users: mockUsers
      };
      
      const updatedUser = { ...mockUsers[0], name: 'John Updated' };
      const action = UserActions.updateUser({ user: updatedUser });
      const result = userReducer(initialState, action);
      
      expect(result.users[0]).toEqual(updatedUser);
      expect(result.users[1]).toEqual(mockUsers[1]);
    });
  });

  describe('deleteUser action', () => {
    it('should remove user from state', () => {
      const initialState = {
        ...initialUserState,
        users: mockUsers
      };
      
      const action = UserActions.deleteUser({ id: '1' });
      const result = userReducer(initialState, action);
      
      expect(result.users).toHaveLength(1);
      expect(result.users[0]).toEqual(mockUsers[1]);
    });
  });

  describe('selectUser action', () => {
    it('should set selected user', () => {
      const action = UserActions.selectUser({ user: mockUsers[0] });
      const result = userReducer(initialUserState, action);
      
      expect(result.selectedUser).toEqual(mockUsers[0]);
    });
  });
});
```

**3. Testing Effects:**
```typescript
// user.effects.spec.ts
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { provideMockActions } from '@ngrx/effects/testing';
import { Observable, of, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { Action } from '@ngrx/store';
import { UserEffects } from './user.effects';
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service';
import * as UserActions from './user.actions';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';
import { hot, cold } from 'jasmine-marbles';

describe('UserEffects', () => {
  let actions$: Observable<Action>;
  let effects: UserEffects;

**Best Practices for NgRx Testing:**

1. **Test in Isolation**: Test each layer (actions, reducers, effects, selectors) independently
2. **Use Marble Testing**: Leverage marble diagrams for testing complex async flows in effects
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Always mock HTTP services and other external dependencies
4. **Test Error Scenarios**: Ensure error handling is properly tested
5. **Performance Testing**: Include performance tests for large datasets and complex operations
6. **Integration Testing**: Test the complete flow from component to store
7. **Use Testing Utilities**: Create reusable testing helpers and utilities
8. **Test Selectors Thoroughly**: Ensure selectors work correctly with various state combinations
9. **Snapshot Testing**: Use snapshot testing for complex state structures
10. **Test State Immutability**: Verify that reducers don't mutate the original state

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures robust, maintainable NgRx applications with high confidence in state management reliability.

### Q16: What is NgRx Component Store and how does it differ from the global store?

**Answer:**
NgRx Component Store is a standalone library that provides local state management for Angular components, offering an alternative to the global NgRx store for component-specific state.

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Global Store | Component Store |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Scope | Application-wide | Component-specific |
| Lifecycle | Application lifetime | Component lifetime |
| Boilerplate | High (actions, reducers, effects) | Low (direct methods) |
| DevTools | Full support | Limited support |
| Testing | Complex setup | Simple testing |
| Performance | Global change detection | Local optimization |

**Component Store Implementation:**
```typescript
// user-component.store.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { ComponentStore } from '@ngrx/component-store';
import { Observable, EMPTY } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError, switchMap, tap } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service';

export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
}

export interface UserComponentState {
  users: User[];
  selectedUser: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  filters: {
    search: string;
    role: string | null;
  };
}

const initialState: UserComponentState = {
  users: [],
  selectedUser: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  filters: {
    search: '',
    role: null
  }
};

@Injectable()
export class UserComponentStore extends ComponentStore<UserComponentState> {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {

  // Selectors
  readonly users$ = this.select(state => state.users);

**Testing Component Store:**
```typescript
// user-component.store.spec.ts
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { UserComponentStore } from './user-component.store';
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service';
import { of, throwError } from 'rxjs';

**When to Use Component Store:**

1. **Component-specific state**: State that doesn't need to be shared across the application
2. **Form management**: Complex forms with local validation and state
3. **UI state**: Modal states, accordion states, tab selections
4. **Local caching**: Component-level data caching
5. **Temporary state**: State that should be cleaned up when component is destroyed
6. **Performance optimization**: Avoiding global state updates for local changes
7. **Micro-frontends**: Isolated state management for independent components
8. **Prototyping**: Quick state management without global store setup

**Benefits of Component Store:**

- **Reduced boilerplate**: No need for actions, reducers, or effects setup
- **Better performance**: Local state changes don't trigger global change detection
- **Easier testing**: Simpler test setup and isolation
- **Automatic cleanup**: State is automatically cleaned up when component is destroyed
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with strong typing
- **Reactive patterns**: Built on RxJS for powerful reactive programming
- **Selective subscriptions**: Components can subscribe to specific state slices

Component Store is ideal for local state management while the global store handles application-wide state, providing a balanced approach to state management in Angular applications.

### Q17: What is NgRx Data and how does it simplify entity management?

**Answer:**
NgRx Data is an extension library that provides automated entity management for NgRx applications, reducing boilerplate code for common CRUD operations and entity state management.

**Key Features:**

1. **Automatic Entity Collections**: Pre-built reducers, actions, and effects for entities
2. **EntityDataService**: HTTP operations with caching and optimistic updates
3. **EntityMetadata**: Configuration for entity behavior and relationships
4. **EntityCollectionService**: Simplified API for component interaction
5. **Automatic Change Tracking**: Built-in dirty checking and change detection

**Setup and Configuration:**
```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { EntityDataModule } from '@ngrx/data';
import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
import { entityConfig } from './entity-metadata';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forRoot({}),
    EffectsModule.forRoot([]),
    EntityDataModule.forRoot(entityConfig)
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**Entity Metadata Configuration:**
```typescript
// entity-metadata.ts
import { EntityMetadataMap, EntityDataModuleConfig } from '@ngrx/data';

const entityMetadata: EntityMetadataMap = {
  User: {
    selectId: (user: User) => user.id,
    sortComparer: (a: User, b: User) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name),
    entityDispatcherOptions: {
      optimisticAdd: true,
      optimisticUpdate: true,
      optimisticDelete: false
    }
  },
  Product: {
    selectId: (product: Product) => product.id,
    sortComparer: (a: Product, b: Product) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name),
    filterFn: (entities: Product[], pattern: string) => {
      return entities.filter(product => 
        product.name.toLowerCase().includes(pattern.toLowerCase()) ||
        product.category.toLowerCase().includes(pattern.toLowerCase())
      );
    }
  },
  Order: {
    selectId: (order: Order) => order.id,
    sortComparer: (a: Order, b: Order) => 
      new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime(),
    additionalCollectionState: {
      selectedOrderId: null as string | null,
      orderFilters: {
        status: null as string | null,
        dateRange: null as { start: Date; end: Date } | null
      }
    }
  }
};

const pluralNames = {
  User: 'Users',
  Product: 'Products', 
  Order: 'Orders'
};

export const entityConfig: EntityDataModuleConfig = {
  entityMetadata,
  pluralNames
};
```

**Entity Models:**
```typescript
// models/user.model.ts
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user' | 'manager';
  department: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// models/product.model.ts
export interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  category: string;
  inStock: boolean;
  quantity: number;
  imageUrl: string;
  tags: string[];
}

// models/order.model.ts
export interface Order {
  id: string;

**Custom EntityDataService:**
```typescript

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { DefaultDataService, HttpUrlGenerator } from '@ngrx/data';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

@Injectable()
export class UserDataService extends DefaultDataService<User> {
  constructor(
    http: HttpClient,
    httpUrlGenerator: HttpUrlGenerator
  ) {
    super('User', http, httpUrlGenerator);
  }

  // Override default getAll to add custom filtering
  override getAll(): Observable<User[]> {
    return this.http.get<{ users: User[]; total: number }>(`${this.entityUrl}?include=department`)
      .pipe(
        map(response => response.users),
        catchError(this.handleError)
      );
  }

  // Custom method for getting users by department
  getUsersByDepartment(department: string): Observable<User[]> {
    return this.http.get<User[]>(`${this.entityUrl}?department=${department}`);
  }

  // Custom method for bulk operations
  bulkUpdate(users: Partial<User>[]): Observable<User[]> {
    return this.http.put<User[]>(`${this.entityUrl}/bulk`, { users });
  }

  // Override add to include custom validation
  override add(user: User): Observable<User> {
    const userWithDefaults = {
      ...user,
      isActive: true,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      updatedAt: new Date()
    };
    return super.add(userWithDefaults);

  // Custom search method
  searchUsers(query: string): Observable<User[]> {

  }
}
```

**EntityCollectionService Usage:**
```typescript
// services/user.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { EntityCollectionServiceBase, EntityCollectionServiceElementsFactory } from '@ngrx/data';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

  // Custom selectors
  get activeUsers$(): Observable<User[]> {

        users.reduce((acc, user) => {
          if (!acc[user.department]) {
            acc[user.department] = [];
          }
          acc[user.department].push(user);
          return acc;
        }, {} as { [department: string]: User[] })
      )
    );
  }

  get adminUsers$(): Observable<User[]> {
    return this.filteredEntities$.pipe(
      map(users => users.filter(user => user.role === 'admin'))
    );
  }

  // Custom actions
  loadUsersByDepartment(department: string): Observable<User[]> {
    return this.userDataService.getUsersByDepartment(department);
  }

  searchUsers(query: string): void {
    this.userDataService.searchUsers(query).subscribe(users => {
      this.setFilter(user => 
        users.some(searchUser => searchUser.id === user.id)
      );
    });
  }

  bulkUpdateUsers(updates: Partial<User>[]): Observable<User[]> {
    return this.userDataService.bulkUpdate(updates);
  }

  activateUser(userId: string): void {
    const user = this.getByKey(userId);
    if (user) {
      this.update({ ...user, isActive: true, updatedAt: new Date() });
    }
  }

  deactivateUser(userId: string): void {
    const user = this.getByKey(userId);
    if (user) {
      this.update({ ...user, isActive: false, updatedAt: new Date() });
    }
  }

  // Batch operations
  addMultipleUsers(users: User[]): void {
    users.forEach(user => this.add(user));
  }

  deleteMultipleUsers(userIds: string[]): void {
    userIds.forEach(id => this.delete(id));
  }
}
```

**Benefits of NgRx Data:**

1. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Eliminates need for manual actions, reducers, and effects
2. **Automatic CRUD Operations**: Built-in create, read, update, delete functionality
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with automatic rollback on errors
4. **Caching**: Intelligent caching with configurable cache strategies
5. **Change Tracking**: Automatic dirty checking and change detection
6. **Relationship Management**: Support for entity relationships and foreign keys
7. **Customizable**: Extensible with custom data services and metadata
8. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strong typing

**When to Use NgRx Data:**

- Applications with many entity types requiring CRUD operations
- RESTful APIs with standard HTTP patterns
- Need for automatic caching and optimistic updates
- Want to reduce NgRx boilerplate code
- Require entity relationship management
- Building data-driven applications with complex entity interactions

NgRx Data significantly simplifies entity management while maintaining the benefits of NgRx's reactive state management pattern.

### Q18: How do you optimize NgRx performance and prevent common performance issues?

**Answer:**
NgRx performance optimization involves strategic selector design, efficient state structure, proper subscription management, and leveraging Angular's change detection optimizations.

**1. Selector Optimization:**

```typescript
// selectors/user.selectors.ts
import { createSelector, createFeatureSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
import { UserState } from '../reducers/user.reducer';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

// Feature selector
export const selectUserState = createFeatureSelector<UserState>('users');

// Basic selectors
export const selectAllUsers = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  state => state.users
);

export const selectUserLoading = createSelector(
  selectUserState,
  state => state.loading
);

// Memoized computed selectors
export const selectActiveUsers = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  users => users.filter(user => user.isActive) // Only recomputes when users array changes
);

// Parameterized selectors with proper memoization
export const selectUsersByDepartment = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  (users: User[], props: { department: string }) => 
    users.filter(user => user.department === props.department)
);

// Complex computed selectors
export const selectUserStatistics = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  users => {
    const stats = {
      total: users.length,
      active: 0,
      inactive: 0,
      byDepartment: {} as Record<string, number>,
      byRole: {} as Record<string, number>
    };
    
    users.forEach(user => {
      if (user.isActive) stats.active++;
      else stats.inactive++;
      
      stats.byDepartment[user.department] = 
        (stats.byDepartment[user.department] || 0) + 1;
      
      stats.byRole[user.role] = 
        (stats.byRole[user.role] || 0) + 1;
    });
    
    return stats;
  }
);

// Avoid creating objects in selectors - use factory pattern
export const createUserSelectorFactory = () => {
  const selectUserById = createSelector(
    selectAllUsers,
    (users: User[], props: { id: string }) => 
      users.find(user => user.id === props.id)
  );
  
  return selectUserById;
};

// Efficient filtering with indexes
export const selectUserLookup = createSelector(
  selectAllUsers,
  users => users.reduce((lookup, user) => {
    lookup[user.id] = user;
    return lookup;
  }, {} as Record<string, User>)
);

export const selectUserByIdOptimized = createSelector(
  selectUserLookup,
  (lookup: Record<string, User>, props: { id: string }) => lookup[props.id]
);
```

**2. State Structure Optimization:**

```typescript
// reducers/optimized-user.reducer.ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import { EntityState, EntityAdapter, createEntityAdapter } from '@ngrx/entity';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';
import * as UserActions from '../actions/user.actions';

// Use Entity Adapter for normalized state
export interface UserState extends EntityState<User> {
  selectedUserId: string | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  filters: {
    department: string | null;
    role: string | null;
    search: string;
  };
  pagination: {
    currentPage: number;
    pageSize: number;
    totalItems: number;
  };
  // Separate UI state from entity state
  ui: {
    showInactive: boolean;
    sortBy: 'name' | 'email' | 'department';
    sortDirection: 'asc' | 'desc';
  };
}

// Entity adapter with custom sorting
export const userAdapter: EntityAdapter<User> = createEntityAdapter<User>({
  selectId: (user: User) => user.id,
  sortComparer: (a: User, b: User) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name)
});

export const initialState: UserState = userAdapter.getInitialState({
  selectedUserId: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  filters: {
    department: null,
    role: null,
    search: ''
  },
  pagination: {
    currentPage: 1,
    pageSize: 20,
    totalItems: 0
  },
  ui: {
    showInactive: false,
    sortBy: 'name',
    sortDirection: 'asc'
  }
});

export const userReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  
  // Efficient bulk operations
  on(UserActions.loadUsersSuccess, (state, { users, totalItems }) => 
    userAdapter.setAll(users, {
      ...state,
      loading: false,
      error: null,
      pagination: {
        ...state.pagination,
        totalItems
      }
    })
  ),
  
  // Optimistic updates
  on(UserActions.addUser, (state, { user }) => 
    userAdapter.addOne(user, {
      ...state,
      // Don't set loading for optimistic updates
    })
  ),
  
  on(UserActions.updateUser, (state, { update }) => 
    userAdapter.updateOne(update, state)
  ),
  
  on(UserActions.deleteUser, (state, { id }) => 
    userAdapter.removeOne(id, state)
  ),
  
  // Separate UI state updates
  on(UserActions.setFilters, (state, { filters }) => ({
    ...state,
    filters: { ...state.filters, ...filters }
  })),
  
  on(UserActions.setUiState, (state, { ui }) => ({
    ...state,
    ui: { ...state.ui, ...ui }
  }))
);

// Export entity selectors
export const {
  selectIds,
  selectEntities,
  selectAll,
  selectTotal
} = userAdapter.getSelectors();
```

**3. Component Optimization:**

```typescript
// components/optimized-user-list.component.ts
import { 
  Component, 
  OnInit, 
  OnDestroy, 
  ChangeDetectionStrategy,
  TrackByFunction 
} from '@angular/core';
import { Observable, Subject, combineLatest } from 'rxjs';
import { takeUntil, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, startWith } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';
import * as UserSelectors from '../selectors/user.selectors';
import * as UserActions from '../actions/user.actions';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-optimized-user-list',
  template: `
    <div class="user-list">
      <!-- Virtual scrolling for large lists -->
      <cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport itemSize="80" class="user-viewport">
        <div 
          *cdkVirtualFor="let user of filteredUsers$ | async; trackBy: trackByUserId"
          class="user-item"
          [class.selected]="(selectedUserId$ | async) === user.id"
        >
          <app-user-card

**4. Subscription Management:**

```typescript
// services/subscription-manager.service.ts
import { Injectable, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { Subject, Subscription, Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class SubscriptionManager implements OnDestroy {
  private destroy$ = new Subject<void>();
  private subscriptions = new Set<Subscription>();
  
  // Automatic cleanup with takeUntil
  takeUntilDestroy<T>(source$: Observable<T>): Observable<T> {
    return source$.pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$));
  }
  
  // Manual subscription management
  add(subscription: Subscription): void {
    this.subscriptions.add(subscription);
  }
  
  // Cleanup
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
    
    this.subscriptions.forEach(sub => sub.unsubscribe());
    this.subscriptions.clear();
  }
}

// Usage in components
@Component({
  providers: [SubscriptionManager]
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private subManager: SubscriptionManager) {}
  
  ngOnInit() {
    // Automatic cleanup
    this.subManager.takeUntilDestroy(this.someObservable$)
      .subscribe(data => {

    // Manual subscription
    const sub = this.anotherObservable$.subscribe();

} from 'rxjs/operators';
import * as UserActions from '../actions/user.actions';
import * as UserSelectors from '../selectors/user.selectors';
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service';

@Injectable()

      debounceTime(300),
      distinctUntilChanged((prev, curr) => prev.query === curr.query),
      switchMap(({ query }) => {
        if (!query.trim()) {
          return of(UserActions.clearSearch());
        }
        
        return this.userService.searchUsers(query).pipe(

        const fiveMinutesAgo = Date.now() - 5 * 60 * 1000;
        return !lastUpdated || lastUpdated < fiveMinutesAgo || users.length === 0;
      }),
      switchMap(() =>

          catchError(error => of(UserActions.batchUpdateUsersFailure({ error: error.message })))
        )
      )
    )
  );
  
  // Optimistic updates with rollback
  updateUser$ = createEffect(() =>

    )
  );
  
  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private store: Store,
    private userService: UserService
  ) {}
}
```

**6. Performance Monitoring:**

```typescript
// utils/performance-monitor.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { tap, timestamp, pairwise } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class PerformanceMonitor {
  private metrics = new Map<string, number[]>();
  
  constructor(private store: Store) {}
  
  // Monitor selector performance
  monitorSelector<T>(selectorName: string, selector$: Observable<T>) {
    return selector$.pipe(
      timestamp(),
      pairwise(),
      tap(([prev, curr]) => {
        const timeDiff = curr.timestamp - prev.timestamp;
        this.recordMetric(selectorName, timeDiff);
        
        if (timeDiff > 100) { // Log slow selectors
          console.warn(`Slow selector ${selectorName}: ${timeDiff}ms`);
        }
      }),
      map(([prev, curr]) => curr.value)
    );
  }
  
  // Monitor action dispatch performance
  monitorAction(actionType: string) {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    return {
      complete: () => {
        const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
        this.recordMetric(`action_${actionType}`, duration);
        
        if (duration > 50) {
          console.warn(`Slow action ${actionType}: ${duration}ms`);
        }
      }
    };
  }
  
  private recordMetric(name: string, value: number) {
    if (!this.metrics.has(name)) {
      this.metrics.set(name, []);
    }
    
    const values = this.metrics.get(name)!;
    values.push(value);
    
    // Keep only last 100 measurements
    if (values.length > 100) {
      values.shift();
    }
  }
  
  getMetrics() {
    const report = new Map<string, any>();
    
    this.metrics.forEach((values, name) => {
      const avg = values.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / values.length;
      const max = Math.max(...values);
      const min = Math.min(...values);
      
      report.set(name, { avg, max, min, count: values.length });
    });
    
    return report;
  }
}
```

**Performance Best Practices:**

1. **Use OnPush Change Detection**: Reduces unnecessary change detection cycles
2. **Implement TrackBy Functions**: Optimizes *ngFor rendering
3. **Leverage Virtual Scrolling**: For large lists
4. **Normalize State Structure**: Use Entity adapters for flat, normalized state
5. **Memoize Selectors**: Prevent unnecessary recomputations
6. **Debounce User Input**: Reduce action dispatching frequency
7. **Use Lazy Loading**: Load features and state on demand
8. **Implement Pagination**: Limit data loaded at once
9. **Cache API Responses**: Avoid redundant HTTP requests
10. **Monitor Performance**: Track selector and action performance

These optimizations ensure NgRx applications remain performant even with complex state management requirements.

### Q19: What are advanced NgRx patterns for complex state management scenarios?

**Answer:**
Advanced NgRx patterns help manage complex state scenarios including feature composition, dynamic state, cross-feature communication, and sophisticated data flows.

**1. Feature State Composition:**

```typescript
// state/app.state.ts
import { ActionReducerMap, MetaReducer } from '@ngrx/store';
import { environment } from '../../environments/environment';
import * as fromAuth from '../auth/state/auth.reducer';
import * as fromUser from '../user/state/user.reducer';
import * as fromProduct from '../product/state/product.reducer';
import * as fromCart from '../cart/state/cart.reducer';
import * as fromOrder from '../order/state/order.reducer';

// Root state interface
export interface AppState {
  auth: fromAuth.AuthState;
  user: fromUser.UserState;
  product: fromProduct.ProductState;
  cart: fromCart.CartState;
  order: fromOrder.OrderState;
}

// Root reducers
export const reducers: ActionReducerMap<AppState> = {
  auth: fromAuth.authReducer,
  user: fromUser.userReducer,
  product: fromProduct.productReducer,
  cart: fromCart.cartReducer,
  order: fromOrder.orderReducer
};

// Meta reducers for cross-cutting concerns
export const metaReducers: MetaReducer<AppState>[] = !environment.production
  ? [logger, storeFreeze]
  : [hydrationMetaReducer];

// Logger meta reducer
function logger(reducer: ActionReducer<AppState>): ActionReducer<AppState> {
  return (state, action) => {
    const result = reducer(state, action);
    console.groupCollapsed(action.type);
    console.log('prev state', state);
    console.log('action', action);
    console.log('next state', result);
    console.groupEnd();
    return result;
  };
}

// Hydration meta reducer for persistence
function hydrationMetaReducer(reducer: ActionReducer<AppState>): ActionReducer<AppState> {
  return (state, action) => {
    if (action.type === '@ngrx/store/init') {
      const storageValue = localStorage.getItem('appState');
      if (storageValue) {
        try {
          const parsedState = JSON.parse(storageValue);
          return { ...state, ...parsedState };
        } catch {
          localStorage.removeItem('appState');
        }
      }
    }
    
    const nextState = reducer(state, action);
    
    // Persist specific slices
    const persistedState = {
      auth: nextState.auth,
      user: { ...nextState.user, selectedUser: null }, // Exclude UI state
      cart: nextState.cart
    };
    
    localStorage.setItem('appState', JSON.stringify(persistedState));
    return nextState;
  };
}
```

**2. Dynamic Feature Loading:**

```typescript
// services/dynamic-feature.service.ts
import { Injectable, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { Observable, of } from 'rxjs';
import { map, switchMap, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

export interface FeatureConfig {
  name: string;
  reducerKey: string;
  effectsClass?: any;
  initialState?: any;
}

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class DynamicFeatureService {
  private loadedFeatures = new Set<string>();
  
  constructor(
    private store: Store,
    private injector: Injector
  ) {}
  
  loadFeature(config: FeatureConfig): Observable<boolean> {
    if (this.loadedFeatures.has(config.name)) {
      return of(true);
    }
    
    return this.loadFeatureModule(config.name).pipe(
      switchMap(module => {
        // Register reducer
        this.store.addReducer(config.reducerKey, module.reducer, config.initialState);
        
        // Register effects if provided
        if (config.effectsClass && module.effects) {
          const effects = this.injector.get(module.effects);
          this.store.dispatch({ type: '@ngrx/effects/init', effects });
        }
        
        this.loadedFeatures.add(config.name);
        return of(true);
      }),
      catchError(error => {
        console.error(`Failed to load feature ${config.name}:`, error);
        return of(false);
      })
    );
  }
  
  private loadFeatureModule(featureName: string): Observable<any> {
    // Dynamic import based on feature name
    switch (featureName) {
      case 'analytics':
        return import('../analytics/analytics.module').then(m => m.AnalyticsModule);
      case 'reporting':
        return import('../reporting/reporting.module').then(m => m.ReportingModule);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unknown feature: ${featureName}`);
    }
  }
  
  unloadFeature(featureName: string, reducerKey: string): void {
    if (this.loadedFeatures.has(featureName)) {
      this.store.removeReducer(reducerKey);
      this.loadedFeatures.delete(featureName);
    }
  }
}

// Usage in route guards
@Injectable()
export class FeatureGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private dynamicFeature: DynamicFeatureService) {}
  
  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): Observable<boolean> {
    const featureName = route.data['feature'];
    const config: FeatureConfig = {
      name: featureName,
      reducerKey: featureName,
      effectsClass: route.data['effects']
    };
    
    return this.dynamicFeature.loadFeature(config);
  }
}
```

**3. Cross-Feature Communication:**

```typescript
// patterns/cross-feature-communication.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { map, withLatestFrom, filter, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';
import * as AuthActions from '../auth/state/auth.actions';
import * as UserActions from '../user/state/user.actions';
import * as CartActions from '../cart/state/cart.actions';
import * as NotificationActions from '../notification/state/notification.actions';

// Global event bus for cross-feature communication
export const GlobalEvents = {
  userLoggedIn: '[Global] User Logged In',
  userLoggedOut: '[Global] User Logged Out',
  orderCompleted: '[Global] Order Completed',
  paymentProcessed: '[Global] Payment Processed'
};

// Cross-feature effects
@Injectable()
export class CrossFeatureEffects {
  
  // When user logs in, load their profile and cart
  userLoggedIn$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(AuthActions.loginSuccess),
      map(({ user }) => ({
        type: GlobalEvents.userLoggedIn,
        payload: { userId: user.id, user }
      }))
    )
  );
  
  // Load user data after login
  loadUserDataOnLogin$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType({ type: GlobalEvents.userLoggedIn }),
      switchMap(({ payload }) => [
        UserActions.loadUserProfile({ userId: payload.userId }),
        CartActions.loadCart({ userId: payload.userId })
      ])
    )
  );
  
  // Clear data on logout
  userLoggedOut$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(AuthActions.logout),
      map(() => ({ type: GlobalEvents.userLoggedOut }))
    )
  );
  
  clearDataOnLogout$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType({ type: GlobalEvents.userLoggedOut }),
      switchMap(() => [
        UserActions.clearUserData(),
        CartActions.clearCart(),
        NotificationActions.clearNotifications()
      ])
    )
  );
  
  // Order completion workflow
  orderCompleted$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(OrderActions.createOrderSuccess),
      withLatestFrom(this.store.select(selectCurrentUser)),
      filter(([action, user]) => !!user),
      switchMap(([{ order }, user]) => [
        CartActions.clearCart(),
        NotificationActions.showSuccess({
          message: `Order #${order.id} completed successfully!`
        }),
        UserActions.updateUserStats({
          userId: user.id,
          stats: { totalOrders: user.stats.totalOrders + 1 }
        }),
        { type: GlobalEvents.orderCompleted, payload: { order, user } }
      ])
    )
  );
  
  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private store: Store
  ) {}
}
```

**4. State Synchronization Patterns:**

```typescript
// patterns/state-synchronization.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { Observable, combineLatest, merge } from 'rxjs';
import { map, distinctUntilChanged, filter, debounceTime } from 'rxjs/operators';

// Derived state pattern
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class DerivedStateService {
  
  // Compute cart summary from cart items and products
  cartSummary$ = combineLatest([
    this.store.select(selectCartItems),
    this.store.select(selectProductEntities),
    this.store.select(selectTaxRate),
    this.store.select(selectShippingCost)
  ]).pipe(
    map(([cartItems, products, taxRate, shippingCost]) => {
      const subtotal = cartItems.reduce((sum, item) => {
        const product = products[item.productId];
        return sum + (product ? product.price * item.quantity : 0);
      }, 0);
      
      const tax = subtotal * taxRate;
      const total = subtotal + tax + shippingCost;
      
      return {
        itemCount: cartItems.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.quantity, 0),
        subtotal,
        tax,
        shippingCost,
        total,
        items: cartItems.map(item => ({
          ...item,
          product: products[item.productId],
          lineTotal: products[item.productId] ? 
            products[item.productId].price * item.quantity : 0
        }))
      };
    }),
    distinctUntilChanged((prev, curr) => 
      JSON.stringify(prev) === JSON.stringify(curr)
    )
  );
  
  // User dashboard data aggregation
  userDashboard$ = combineLatest([
    this.store.select(selectCurrentUser),
    this.store.select(selectUserOrders),
    this.store.select(selectUserWishlist),
    this.store.select(selectUserReviews),
    this.store.select(selectUserRewards)
  ]).pipe(
    filter(([user]) => !!user),
    map(([user, orders, wishlist, reviews, rewards]) => ({
      user,
      stats: {

        wishlistItems: wishlist.length,
        reviewsWritten: reviews.length,
        rewardPoints: rewards.totalPoints,
        memberSince: user.createdAt
      },
      recentActivity: [
        ...orders.slice(0, 3).map(order => ({

**5. Advanced Effect Patterns:**

```typescript

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';

                  return throwError(error);
                }
                const delayTime = Math.pow(2, index) * 1000; // Exponential backoff

            )
          ),

        )
      )
    )

  // Timeout pattern

      filter(actions => actions.length > 0),
      switchMap(actions => {

            )
          ),

        )
      )
    )
  );
  
  // Conditional effects based on state

    )
  );
  
  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private store: Store,
    private dataService: DataService
  ) {}
}
```

**6. State Machine Pattern:**

```typescript
// patterns/state-machine.ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';

// Define states and transitions
export enum OrderState {
  DRAFT = 'draft',
  PENDING = 'pending',
  CONFIRMED = 'confirmed',
  PROCESSING = 'processing',
  SHIPPED = 'shipped',
  DELIVERED = 'delivered',
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled',
  REFUNDED = 'refunded'
}

export interface OrderStateMachine {
  currentState: OrderState;
  allowedTransitions: OrderState[];
  history: { state: OrderState; timestamp: Date; reason?: string }[];
}

// State transition rules
const stateTransitions: Record<OrderState, OrderState[]> = {
  [OrderState.DRAFT]: [OrderState.PENDING, OrderState.CANCELLED],
  [OrderState.PENDING]: [OrderState.CONFIRMED, OrderState.CANCELLED],
  [OrderState.CONFIRMED]: [OrderState.PROCESSING, OrderState.CANCELLED],
  [OrderState.PROCESSING]: [OrderState.SHIPPED, OrderState.CANCELLED],
  [OrderState.SHIPPED]: [OrderState.DELIVERED],
  [OrderState.DELIVERED]: [OrderState.REFUNDED],
  [OrderState.CANCELLED]: [],
  [OrderState.REFUNDED]: []
};

// State machine reducer
export const orderStateMachineReducer = createReducer(
  {
    currentState: OrderState.DRAFT,
    allowedTransitions: stateTransitions[OrderState.DRAFT],
    history: []
  } as OrderStateMachine,
  
  on(OrderActions.transitionState, (state, { newState, reason }) => {
    // Validate transition
    if (!state.allowedTransitions.includes(newState)) {
      console.error(`Invalid transition from ${state.currentState} to ${newState}`);
      return state;
    }
    
    return {
      currentState: newState,
      allowedTransitions: stateTransitions[newState],
      history: [
        ...state.history,
        {
          state: newState,
          timestamp: new Date(),
          reason
        }
      ]
    };
  })
);
```

These advanced patterns enable sophisticated state management for complex applications while maintaining clean architecture and predictable data flow.

### Q20: How do you implement comprehensive error handling and resilience patterns in NgRx?

**Answer:**
Robust error handling in NgRx involves multiple layers of error management, graceful degradation, retry mechanisms, and user-friendly error reporting.

**1. Centralized Error State Management:**

```typescript
// state/error.state.ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import { createEntityAdapter, EntityAdapter, EntityState } from '@ngrx/entity';

export interface AppError {
  id: string;
  type: 'network' | 'validation' | 'business' | 'system';
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  message: string;
  details?: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  source: string; // Which feature/component caused the error
  userMessage?: string; // User-friendly message
  retryable: boolean;
  retryCount: number;
  maxRetries: number;
  resolved: boolean;
}

export interface ErrorState extends EntityState<AppError> {
  globalError: AppError | null;
  networkStatus: 'online' | 'offline' | 'slow';
  errorCounts: Record<string, number>;
  suppressedErrors: string[]; // Error types to suppress
}

export const errorAdapter: EntityAdapter<AppError> = createEntityAdapter<AppError>({
  selectId: (error: AppError) => error.id,
  sortComparer: (a: AppError, b: AppError) => 
    new Date(b.timestamp).getTime() - new Date(a.timestamp).getTime()
});

export const initialErrorState: ErrorState = errorAdapter.getInitialState({
  globalError: null,
  networkStatus: 'online',
  errorCounts: {},
  suppressedErrors: []
});

export const errorReducer = createReducer(
  initialErrorState,
  
  on(ErrorActions.addError, (state, { error }) => {
    const errorWithId = {
      ...error,
      id: error.id || generateErrorId(),
      timestamp: new Date(),
      retryCount: 0,
      resolved: false
    };
    
    return errorAdapter.addOne(errorWithId, {
      ...state,
      globalError: error.severity === 'critical' ? errorWithId : state.globalError,
      errorCounts: {
        ...state.errorCounts,
        [error.type]: (state.errorCounts[error.type] || 0) + 1
      }
    });
  }),
  
  on(ErrorActions.resolveError, (state, { errorId }) => 
    errorAdapter.updateOne(
      { id: errorId, changes: { resolved: true } },
      { ...state, globalError: state.globalError?.id === errorId ? null : state.globalError }
    )
  ),
  
  on(ErrorActions.retryError, (state, { errorId }) => 
    errorAdapter.updateOne(
      { id: errorId, changes: { retryCount: state.entities[errorId]!.retryCount + 1 } },
      state
    )
  ),
  
  on(ErrorActions.clearErrors, (state) => 
    errorAdapter.removeAll({ ...state, globalError: null, errorCounts: {} })
  ),
  
  on(ErrorActions.setNetworkStatus, (state, { status }) => ({
    ...state,
    networkStatus: status
  })),
  
  on(ErrorActions.suppressErrorType, (state, { errorType }) => ({
    ...state,
    suppressedErrors: [...state.suppressedErrors, errorType]
  }))
);

function generateErrorId(): string {
  return `error_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
}
```

**2. Error Actions and Selectors:**

```typescript
// actions/error.actions.ts
import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';
import { AppError } from '../state/error.state';

export const addError = createAction(
  '[Error] Add Error',
  props<{ error: Partial<AppError> }>()
);

export const resolveError = createAction(
  '[Error] Resolve Error',
  props<{ errorId: string }>()
);

export const retryError = createAction(
  '[Error] Retry Error',
  props<{ errorId: string }>()
);

export const clearErrors = createAction('[Error] Clear All Errors');

export const setNetworkStatus = createAction(
  '[Error] Set Network Status',
  props<{ status: 'online' | 'offline' | 'slow' }>()
);

export const suppressErrorType = createAction(
  '[Error] Suppress Error Type',
  props<{ errorType: string }>()
);

// selectors/error.selectors.ts
import { createFeatureSelector, createSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
import { ErrorState, errorAdapter } from '../state/error.state';

export const selectErrorState = createFeatureSelector<ErrorState>('errors');

export const {
  selectIds: selectErrorIds,
  selectEntities: selectErrorEntities,
  selectAll: selectAllErrors,
  selectTotal: selectTotalErrors
} = errorAdapter.getSelectors(selectErrorState);

export const selectGlobalError = createSelector(
  selectErrorState,
  state => state.globalError
);

export const selectNetworkStatus = createSelector(
  selectErrorState,
  state => state.networkStatus
);

export const selectUnresolvedErrors = createSelector(
  selectAllErrors,
  errors => errors.filter(error => !error.resolved)
);

export const selectErrorsByType = createSelector(
  selectAllErrors,
  (errors, props: { type: string }) => 
    errors.filter(error => error.type === props.type)
);

export const selectRetryableErrors = createSelector(
  selectUnresolvedErrors,
  errors => errors.filter(error => 
    error.retryable && error.retryCount < error.maxRetries
  )
);

export const selectErrorCounts = createSelector(
  selectErrorState,
  state => state.errorCounts
);
```

### Q21: How do you implement real-time updates and WebSocket integration with NgRx?

**Answer:**
Integrating real-time updates with NgRx involves managing WebSocket connections, handling real-time data streams, and maintaining synchronization between local and remote state.

**1. WebSocket State Management:**

```typescript
// state/websocket.state.ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import { createEntityAdapter, EntityAdapter, EntityState } from '@ngrx/entity';

export interface WebSocketConnection {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  status: 'connecting' | 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'error';
  lastConnected?: Date;
  reconnectAttempts: number;
  maxReconnectAttempts: number;
  subscriptions: string[];
  heartbeatInterval?: number;
  lastHeartbeat?: Date;
}

export interface RealtimeMessage {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  payload: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  connectionId: string;
  processed: boolean;
}

export interface WebSocketState extends EntityState<WebSocketConnection> {
  messages: RealtimeMessage[];
  globalConnectionStatus: 'online' | 'offline' | 'degraded';
  messageQueue: RealtimeMessage[]; // For offline queuing
  subscriptionTopics: Record<string, string[]>; // topic -> connectionIds
}

export const connectionAdapter: EntityAdapter<WebSocketConnection> = 
  createEntityAdapter<WebSocketConnection>({
    selectId: (connection: WebSocketConnection) => connection.id
  });

export const initialWebSocketState: WebSocketState = connectionAdapter.getInitialState({
  messages: [],
  globalConnectionStatus: 'offline',
  messageQueue: [],
  subscriptionTopics: {}
});

export const webSocketReducer = createReducer(
  initialWebSocketState,
  
  on(WebSocketActions.connectRequest, (state, { connectionConfig }) => 
    connectionAdapter.addOne({
      id: connectionConfig.id,
      url: connectionConfig.url,
      status: 'connecting',
      reconnectAttempts: 0,
      maxReconnectAttempts: connectionConfig.maxReconnectAttempts || 5,
      subscriptions: [],
      heartbeatInterval: connectionConfig.heartbeatInterval
    }, state)
  ),
  
  on(WebSocketActions.connectionEstablished, (state, { connectionId }) => 
    connectionAdapter.updateOne(
      {
        id: connectionId,
        changes: {
          status: 'connected',
          lastConnected: new Date(),
          reconnectAttempts: 0
        }
      },
      {
        ...state,
        globalConnectionStatus: 'online'
      }
    )
  ),
  
  on(WebSocketActions.connectionLost, (state, { connectionId, error }) => 
    connectionAdapter.updateOne(
      {
        id: connectionId,
        changes: {
          status: 'disconnected',
          reconnectAttempts: state.entities[connectionId]!.reconnectAttempts + 1
        }
      },
      {
        ...state,
        globalConnectionStatus: 'degraded'
      }
    )
  ),
  
  on(WebSocketActions.messageReceived, (state, { message }) => ({
    ...state,
    messages: [message, ...state.messages.slice(0, 99)] // Keep last 100 messages
  })),
  
  on(WebSocketActions.subscribeToTopic, (state, { connectionId, topic }) => {
    const connection = state.entities[connectionId];
    if (!connection) return state;
    
    return connectionAdapter.updateOne(
      {
        id: connectionId,
        changes: {
          subscriptions: [...connection.subscriptions, topic]
        }
      },
      {
        ...state,
        subscriptionTopics: {
          ...state.subscriptionTopics,
          [topic]: [...(state.subscriptionTopics[topic] || []), connectionId]
        }
      }
    );
  }),
  
  on(WebSocketActions.queueMessage, (state, { message }) => ({
    ...state,
    messageQueue: [...state.messageQueue, message]
  })),
  
  on(WebSocketActions.processQueuedMessages, (state) => ({
    ...state,
    messages: [...state.messageQueue, ...state.messages],
    messageQueue: []
  }))
);
```

**2. WebSocket Actions:**

```typescript
// actions/websocket.actions.ts
import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';
import { RealtimeMessage, WebSocketConnection } from '../state/websocket.state';

export interface ConnectionConfig {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  protocols?: string[];
  maxReconnectAttempts?: number;
  heartbeatInterval?: number;
  autoReconnect?: boolean;
}

// Connection Management
export const connectRequest = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Connect Request',
  props<{ connectionConfig: ConnectionConfig }>()
);

export const connectionEstablished = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Connection Established',
  props<{ connectionId: string }>()
);

export const connectionLost = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Connection Lost',
  props<{ connectionId: string; error?: any }>()
);

export const disconnect = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Disconnect',
  props<{ connectionId: string }>()
);

export const reconnectAttempt = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Reconnect Attempt',
  props<{ connectionId: string }>()
);

// Message Handling
export const sendMessage = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Send Message',
  props<{ connectionId: string; message: any }>()
);

export const messageReceived = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Message Received',
  props<{ message: RealtimeMessage }>()
);

export const queueMessage = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Queue Message',
  props<{ message: RealtimeMessage }>()
);

export const processQueuedMessages = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Process Queued Messages'
);

// Subscription Management
export const subscribeToTopic = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Subscribe To Topic',
  props<{ connectionId: string; topic: string; params?: any }>()
);

export const unsubscribeFromTopic = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Unsubscribe From Topic',
  props<{ connectionId: string; topic: string }>()
);

// Heartbeat
export const sendHeartbeat = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Send Heartbeat',
  props<{ connectionId: string }>()
);

export const heartbeatReceived = createAction(
  '[WebSocket] Heartbeat Received',
  props<{ connectionId: string }>()
);
```

**3. WebSocket Effects:**

```typescript
// effects/websocket.effects.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { 
  EMPTY,

```

**4. Real-time Data Integration:**

```typescript
// effects/realtime-data.effects.ts

      })
    )
  );
  
  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private store: Store
  ) {}

import { ConnectionConfig, RealtimeMessage } from '../state/websocket.state';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class WebSocketService {
  
  constructor(private store: Store) {}
  
  // Connect to WebSocket
  connect(config: ConnectionConfig): void {
    this.store.dispatch(
      WebSocketActions.connectRequest({ connectionConfig: config })
    );
  }
  
  // Disconnect from WebSocket

### Q22: How do you implement NgRx in a micro-frontends architecture with state sharing and isolation?

**Answer:**
Implementing NgRx in micro-frontends requires careful consideration of state isolation, shared state management, and communication between different micro-frontend applications.

**1. Micro-frontend State Architecture:**

```typescript
// shared/state/micro-frontend.state.ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import { createEntityAdapter, EntityAdapter, EntityState } from '@ngrx/entity';

export interface MicroFrontend {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  status: 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'error' | 'unloaded';
  mountPath: string;
  remoteEntry: string;
  exposedModule: string;
  sharedDependencies: string[];
  isolatedState: boolean;
  sharedStateKeys: string[];
}

export interface SharedStateSlice {
  key: string;
  data: any;
  version: number;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  ownerMicroFrontend: string;
  subscribers: string[];
}

export interface MicroFrontendState extends EntityState<MicroFrontend> {
  currentMicroFrontend: string | null;
  sharedState: Record<string, SharedStateSlice>;
  communicationChannels: Record<string, any>;
  globalEvents: any[];
  stateSync: {
    enabled: boolean;
    strategy: 'broadcast' | 'centralized' | 'peer-to-peer';
    conflictResolution: 'last-write-wins' | 'merge' | 'manual';
  };
}

export const microFrontendAdapter: EntityAdapter<MicroFrontend> = 
  createEntityAdapter<MicroFrontend>({
    selectId: (mf: MicroFrontend) => mf.id
  });

export const initialMicroFrontendState: MicroFrontendState = 
  microFrontendAdapter.getInitialState({
    currentMicroFrontend: null,
    sharedState: {},
    communicationChannels: {},
    globalEvents: [],
    stateSync: {
      enabled: true,
      strategy: 'broadcast',
      conflictResolution: 'last-write-wins'
    }
  });

export const microFrontendReducer = createReducer(
  initialMicroFrontendState,
  
  on(MicroFrontendActions.registerMicroFrontend, (state, { microFrontend }) => 
    microFrontendAdapter.addOne(microFrontend, state)
  ),
  
  on(MicroFrontendActions.setCurrentMicroFrontend, (state, { microFrontendId }) => ({
    ...state,
    currentMicroFrontend: microFrontendId
  })),
  
  on(MicroFrontendActions.updateSharedState, (state, { key, data, ownerMicroFrontend }) => ({
    ...state,
    sharedState: {
      ...state.sharedState,
      [key]: {
        key,
        data,
        version: (state.sharedState[key]?.version || 0) + 1,
        lastUpdated: new Date(),
        ownerMicroFrontend,
        subscribers: state.sharedState[key]?.subscribers || []
      }
    }
  })),
  
  on(MicroFrontendActions.subscribeToSharedState, (state, { key, microFrontendId }) => {
    const currentSlice = state.sharedState[key];
    if (!currentSlice) return state;
    
    return {
      ...state,
      sharedState: {
        ...state.sharedState,
        [key]: {
          ...currentSlice,
          subscribers: [...new Set([...currentSlice.subscribers, microFrontendId])]
        }
      }
    };
  }),
  
  on(MicroFrontendActions.addGlobalEvent, (state, { event }) => ({
    ...state,
    globalEvents: [event, ...state.globalEvents.slice(0, 99)] // Keep last 100 events
  }))
);
```

**2. State Isolation Service:**

```typescript
// services/state-isolation.service.ts
import { Injectable, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { Store, StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { Observable, BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

}

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })

  private isolatedStores = new Map<string, Store>();
  private storeConfigs = new Map<string, IsolatedStoreConfig>();
  private sharedStateSubject = new BehaviorSubject<Record<string, any>>({});
  
  constructor(
    private globalStore: Store,
    private injector: Injector
  ) {}
  
  // Create isolated store for micro-frontend
  createIsolatedStore(config: IsolatedStoreConfig): Store {
    const { microFrontendId, isolatedReducers, sharedReducers, effects } = config;
    
    // Combine isolated and shared reducers
    const combinedReducers = {
      ...isolatedReducers,
      ...(sharedReducers || {}),
      microFrontend: microFrontendReducer
    };
    
    // Create isolated injector
    const isolatedInjector = Injector.create({
      providers: [
        {
          provide: Store,
          useFactory: () => {
            // Create store with combined reducers
            const storeModule = StoreModule.forRoot(combinedReducers);
            const effectsModule = effects ? EffectsModule.forRoot(effects) : null;
            
            // This is a simplified version - in practice, you'd need to
            // properly bootstrap the store with the Angular module system
            return new Store(combinedReducers, this.injector);
          }
        }
      ],
      parent: this.injector
    });
    
    const isolatedStore = isolatedInjector.get(Store);
    
    // Store references
    this.isolatedStores.set(microFrontendId, isolatedStore);
    this.storeConfigs.set(microFrontendId, config);
    
    // Setup state synchronization
    this.setupStateSynchronization(microFrontendId, isolatedStore, config);
    
    return isolatedStore;
  }
  
  // Get isolated store for micro-frontend
  getIsolatedStore(microFrontendId: string): Store | null {
    return this.isolatedStores.get(microFrontendId) || null;
  }
  
  // Setup bidirectional state synchronization
  private setupStateSynchronization(
    microFrontendId: string, 
    isolatedStore: Store, 
    config: IsolatedStoreConfig
  ) {
    const { sharedStateKeys = [] } = config;
    
    // Sync from isolated store to global store
    sharedStateKeys.forEach(stateKey => {
      isolatedStore.select(state => state[stateKey]).subscribe(stateSlice => {
        if (stateSlice !== undefined) {
          this.globalStore.dispatch(
            MicroFrontendActions.updateSharedState({
              key: stateKey,
              data: stateSlice,
              ownerMicroFrontend: microFrontendId
            })
          );
        }
      });
    });
    
    // Sync from global store to isolated store
    this.globalStore.select(state => state.microFrontend?.sharedState)
      .pipe(
        filter(sharedState => !!sharedState),
        map(sharedState => {
          const relevantState: Record<string, any> = {};
          sharedStateKeys.forEach(key => {
            if (sharedState[key] && 
                sharedState[key].ownerMicroFrontend !== microFrontendId) {
              relevantState[key] = sharedState[key].data;
            }
          });
          return relevantState;
        })
      )
      .subscribe(relevantState => {
        Object.keys(relevantState).forEach(key => {
          isolatedStore.dispatch({
            type: `[Shared] Update ${key}`,
            payload: relevantState[key]
          });
        });
      });

**4. Micro-Frontend Store Factory:**

```typescript
// factories/micro-frontend-store.factory.ts
import { Injectable, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { Store, StoreModule, ActionReducer, MetaReducer } from '@ngrx/store';
import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects';

          remoteEntry: '',
          exposedModule: '',
          sharedDependencies: [],
          isolatedState: false,
          sharedStateKeys: config.sharedStateKeys || []
        }
      })
    );
    
    return globalStore;
  }
  
  // Create meta-reducer for communication
  private createCommunicationMetaReducer(

        }
        
        return reducer(state, action);
      };
    };
  }
}
```

**5. Micro-Frontend Module:**

```typescript
// modules/micro-frontend.module.ts
import { NgModule, ModuleWithProviders } from '@angular/core';
import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { MicroFrontendStoreFactory, MicroFrontendStoreConfig } from '../factories/micro-frontend-store.factory';
import { StateIsolationService } from '../services/state-isolation.service';
import { MicroFrontendCommunicationService } from '../services/micro-frontend-communication.service';
import { microFrontendReducer } from '../state/micro-frontend.state';
import { MicroFrontendEffects } from '../effects/micro-frontend.effects';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forFeature('microFrontend', microFrontendReducer),
    EffectsModule.forFeature([MicroFrontendEffects])
  ],
  providers: [
    StateIsolationService,
    MicroFrontendCommunicationService,
    MicroFrontendStoreFactory
  ]
})
export class MicroFrontendModule {
  
  static forRoot(): ModuleWithProviders<MicroFrontendModule> {
    return {
      ngModule: MicroFrontendModule,
      providers: [
        StateIsolationService,
        MicroFrontendCommunicationService,
        MicroFrontendStoreFactory
      ]
    };
  }
  
  static forChild(config: MicroFrontendStoreConfig): ModuleWithProviders<MicroFrontendModule> {
    return {
      ngModule: MicroFrontendModule,
      providers: [
        {
          provide: 'MICRO_FRONTEND_CONFIG',
          useValue: config
        },
        {
          provide: Store,
          useFactory: (factory: MicroFrontendStoreFactory) => {
            return factory.createStore(config);
          },
          deps: [MicroFrontendStoreFactory]
        }
      ]
    };
  }
}
```

**6. Usage Example:**

```typescript
// micro-frontend-app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { MicroFrontendModule } from './micro-frontend.module';
import { userReducer } from './state/user.reducer';
import { UserEffects } from './effects/user.effects';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    MicroFrontendModule.forChild({
      microFrontendId: 'user-management',
      reducers: {
        users: userReducer
      },
      effects: [UserEffects],
      sharedStateKeys: ['currentUser', 'permissions'],
      isolationLevel: 'partial',
      enableDevTools: true
    })
  ],
  // ... rest of module configuration
})
export class MicroFrontendAppModule {}
```

This architecture provides flexible state management for micro-frontends with configurable isolation levels, inter-application communication, and shared state synchronization while maintaining the benefits of NgRx's predictable state management.

### Q23: What are the best practices for migrating from legacy state management to NgRx or upgrading NgRx versions?

**Answer:**
Migrating to NgRx or upgrading NgRx versions requires careful planning, incremental implementation, and proper testing strategies to ensure smooth transitions.

**1. Migration from Legacy State Management:**

```typescript
// migration/legacy-state-adapter.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { Observable, BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';
import { map, distinctUntilChanged } from 'rxjs/operators';

export interface LegacyStateConfig {
  legacyServiceName: string;
  ngrxFeatureName: string;
  stateMapping: Record<string, string>;
  actionMapping: Record<string, string>;
  migrationPhase: 'preparation' | 'dual-write' | 'dual-read' | 'cleanup';
}

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class LegacyStateAdapterService {
  private migrationConfigs = new Map<string, LegacyStateConfig>();
  private legacyServices = new Map<string, any>();
  
  constructor(private store: Store) {}
  
  // Register legacy service for migration
  registerLegacyService(config: LegacyStateConfig, legacyService: any) {
    this.migrationConfigs.set(config.legacyServiceName, config);
    this.legacyServices.set(config.legacyServiceName, legacyService);
    
    // Setup bidirectional sync based on migration phase
    this.setupMigrationSync(config, legacyService);
  }
  
  // Setup synchronization between legacy and NgRx
  private setupMigrationSync(config: LegacyStateConfig, legacyService: any) {
    const { migrationPhase, stateMapping, actionMapping } = config;
    
    switch (migrationPhase) {
      case 'preparation':
        this.setupPreparationPhase(config, legacyService);
        break;
      case 'dual-write':

        break;
      case 'dual-read':

        break;
    }
  }
  
  // Phase 1: Preparation - Setup NgRx alongside legacy
  private setupPreparationPhase(config: LegacyStateConfig, legacyService: any) {

    // Override methods to write to both systems
    Object.keys(config.actionMapping).forEach(legacyMethod => {

        // Execute original legacy method
        const result = originalMethod.apply(legacyService, args);
        
        // Dispatch corresponding NgRx action
        this.store.dispatch({

        return result;
      };
    });
    
    console.log(`Migration Phase 2 (Dual Write) setup for ${config.legacyServiceName}`);
  }
  
  // Phase 3: Dual Read - Read from NgRx, fallback to legacy
  private setupDualReadPhase(config: LegacyStateConfig, legacyService: any) {

    const legacyState = legacyService.getState();
    const ngrxState = {}; // Get from selectors
    
    return JSON.stringify(legacyState) === JSON.stringify(ngrxState);
  }
}
```

**4. Migration CLI Tool:**

```typescript
// cli/migration-cli.ts
import { Command } from 'commander';
import { NgRxVersionMigrationService } from '../migration/ngrx-version-migration.service';

const program = new Command();
const migrationService = new NgRxVersionMigrationService(null as any);

program
  .name('ngrx-migrate')
  .description('NgRx Migration Tool')
  .version('1.0.0');

program
  .command('analyze')
  .description('Analyze current NgRx usage and migration requirements')
  .option('-f, --from <version>', 'Current NgRx version')
  .option('-t, --to <version>', 'Target NgRx version')
  .action((options) => {
    const report = migrationService.getMigrationReport(options.from, options.to);
    console.log('Migration Analysis Report:');
    console.log(JSON.stringify(report, null, 2));
  });

program
  .command('migrate')
  .description('Execute NgRx migration')
  .option('-f, --from <version>', 'Current NgRx version')
  .option('-t, --to <version>', 'Target NgRx version')
  .option('--dry-run', 'Show what would be changed without making changes')
  .action(async (options) => {
    if (options.dryRun) {
      console.log('Dry run mode - no changes will be made');
      const report = migrationService.getMigrationReport(options.from, options.to);
      console.log(JSON.stringify(report, null, 2));
    } else {
      await migrationService.executeMigration(options.from, options.to);
    }
  });

program
  .command('validate')
  .description('Validate migration results')
  .option('-v, --version <version>', 'NgRx version to validate')
  .action((options) => {
    console.log(`Validating NgRx ${options.version} migration...`);
    // Implementation would run validation checks
  });

program.parse();
```

This comprehensive migration strategy provides tools and services for both legacy-to-NgRx migrations and NgRx version upgrades, with proper testing, validation, and automation capabilities.

### Q24: How do you effectively use NgRx DevTools for debugging and what are advanced debugging techniques?

**Answer:**
NgRx DevTools provide powerful debugging capabilities for state management, action tracking, time-travel debugging, and performance monitoring.

**1. Advanced DevTools Configuration:**

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { StoreDevtoolsModule } from '@ngrx/store-devtools';
import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({
      name: 'MyApp DevTools',
      maxAge: 50, // Retain last 50 states
      logOnly: environment.production, // Restrict extension to log-only mode in production
      autoPause: true, // Pauses recording actions and state changes when extension window is not open
      trace: !environment.production, // Include stack trace for every dispatched action
      traceLimit: 75, // Maximum stack trace frames to be stored
      connectInZone: true, // Connect in Angular zone for better performance
      
      // Custom action sanitizer
      actionSanitizer: (action: any) => {
        if (action.type === '[Auth] Login Success') {
          return {
            ...action,
            payload: {
              ...action.payload,
              token: '***SANITIZED***' // Hide sensitive data
            }
          };
        }
        return action;
      },
      
      // Custom state sanitizer
      stateSanitizer: (state: any) => {
        return {
          ...state,
          auth: {
            ...state.auth,
            token: state.auth?.token ? '***SANITIZED***' : null,
            refreshToken: state.auth?.refreshToken ? '***SANITIZED***' : null
          }
        };
      },
      
      // Predicate to determine which actions to include
      predicate: (state: any, action: any) => {
        // Exclude noisy actions from DevTools
        const excludedActions = [
          '[Router] Navigation',
          '[UI] Mouse Move',
          '[WebSocket] Heartbeat'
        ];
        return !excludedActions.some(excluded => action.type.includes(excluded));
      },
      
      // Features configuration
      features: {
        pause: true, // Start/pause recording of actions
        lock: true, // Lock/unlock dispatching actions and side effects
        persist: true, // Persist states on page reloading
        export: true, // Export history of actions in a file
        import: 'custom', // Import history of actions from a file
        jump: true, // Jump back and forth (time travelling)
        skip: true, // Skip (cancel) actions
        reorder: true, // Drag and drop actions in the history list
        dispatch: true, // Dispatch custom actions or action creators
        test: true // Generate tests for the selected actions
      }
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Q25: What are the best practices and patterns for implementing NgRx in large-scale enterprise applications?

**Answer:**
Enterprise NgRx applications require sophisticated patterns for scalability, maintainability, team collaboration, and performance optimization.

**1. Enterprise State Architecture:**

```typescript
// shared/state/enterprise-state.interface.ts
export interface EnterpriseAppState {
  // Core application state
  core: CoreState;
  
  // Feature modules state
  features: {
    [featureName: string]: any;
  };
  
  // Shared state across features
  shared: SharedState;
  
  // Runtime configuration
  runtime: RuntimeState;
  
  // User context and permissions
  user: UserState;
  
  // Application metadata
  metadata: MetadataState;
}

export interface CoreState {
  loading: LoadingState;
  errors: ErrorState;
  notifications: NotificationState;
  navigation: NavigationState;
  theme: ThemeState;
}

export interface SharedState {
  cache: CacheState;
  lookup: LookupState;
  configuration: ConfigurationState;
  audit: AuditState;
}

export interface RuntimeState {
  environment: EnvironmentInfo;
  features: FeatureFlags;
  performance: PerformanceMetrics;
  monitoring: MonitoringState;
}

export interface UserState {
  profile: UserProfile;
  permissions: Permission[];
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  session: SessionInfo;
  roles: Role[];
}

export interface MetadataState {
  version: string;
  buildInfo: BuildInfo;
  dependencies: DependencyInfo[];
  healthChecks: HealthCheck[];
}
```

**2. Feature Module State Management:**

```typescript
// shared/state/feature-state.factory.ts
import { Injectable, InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';
import { ActionReducerMap, MetaReducer, createFeatureSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
import { environment } from '../../../environments/environment';

export const FEATURE_STATE_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<string>('FeatureStateToken');

export interface FeatureStateConfig {
  featureName: string;
  reducers: ActionReducerMap<any>;
  effects?: any[];
  metaReducers?: MetaReducer<any>[];
  initialState?: any;
  storageKeys?: string[];
  permissions?: string[];
}

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class FeatureStateFactory {
  private registeredFeatures = new Map<string, FeatureStateConfig>();
  
  // Register feature state
  registerFeature(config: FeatureStateConfig): void {
    if (this.registeredFeatures.has(config.featureName)) {
      console.warn(`Feature ${config.featureName} is already registered`);
      return;
    }
    
    // Validate feature configuration
    this.validateFeatureConfig(config);
    
    // Add enterprise meta-reducers

    console.log(`Feature ${config.featureName} registered successfully`);
  }
  
  // Get feature configuration
  getFeatureConfig(featureName: string): FeatureStateConfig | undefined {
    return this.registeredFeatures.get(featureName);
  }
  
  // Create feature selector
  createFeatureSelector<T>(featureName: string) {
    return createFeatureSelector<T>(featureName);
  }
  
  // Validate feature configuration
  private validateFeatureConfig(config: FeatureStateConfig): void {
    if (!config.featureName) {
      throw new Error('Feature name is required');
    }
    
    if (!config.reducers) {
      throw new Error('Feature reducers are required');
    }
    
    // Validate naming conventions
    if (!/^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$/.test(config.featureName)) {
      throw new Error('Feature name must follow camelCase convention');
    }
  }
  
  // Create audit meta-reducer
  private createAuditMetaReducer(featureName: string): MetaReducer<any> {
    return (reducer) => {
      return (state, action) => {
        const newState = reducer(state, action);
        
        // Log state changes for audit
        if (!environment.production && state !== newState) {
          console.log(`[${featureName}] State changed:`, {
            action: action.type,
            previousState: state,
            newState,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
          });
        }
        
        return newState;
      };
    };
  }
  
  // Create performance meta-reducer
  private createPerformanceMetaReducer(featureName: string): MetaReducer<any> {

          });
        }
        
        return newState;
      };
    };
  }
  
  // Create validation meta-reducer
  private createValidationMetaReducer(featureName: string): MetaReducer<any> {
    return (reducer) => {
      return (state, action) => {
        try {
          const newState = reducer(state, action);
          
          // Validate state structure
          this.validateStateStructure(newState, featureName);
          
          return newState;
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`[${featureName}] State validation failed:`, error);
          return state; // Return previous state on validation error
        }
      };
    };
  }
  
  // Validate state structure
  private validateStateStructure(state: any, featureName: string): void {
    if (state === null || state === undefined) {
      throw new Error(`State cannot be null or undefined for feature ${featureName}`);
    }
    
    // Check for circular references
    try {
      JSON.stringify(state);
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error(`Circular reference detected in ${featureName} state`);
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Enterprise Effects Management:**

```typescript
// shared/effects/enterprise-effects.service.ts

### Q26: What is the Facade Pattern in NgRx and why use it?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

The Facade Pattern in NgRx acts as an abstraction layer between the component and the store. It hides the complexity of dispatching actions and selecting state.

**Benefits:**
- **Decoupling:** Components don't depend directly on the Store, Actions, or Selectors.
- **Simplified API:** Components just call methods on the Facade.
- **Reusability:** Logic in the Facade can be reused across components.
- **Testability:** Facades are easier to mock than the Store.

**Example:**
```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class UserFacade {
  users$ = this.store.select(selectAllUsers);
  loading$ = this.store.select(selectUserLoading);

  constructor(private store: Store) {}

  loadUsers() {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.loadUsers());
  }

  addUser(user: User) {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.addUser({ user }));
  }
}
```

### Q27: Explain NgRx Metareducers and their use cases.

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Metareducers are higher-order reducers: they are functions that accept a reducer and return a new reducer. They act like middleware for reducers, allowing you to intercept actions and state changes before they reach the actual reducers.

**Use Cases:**
- **Logging:** Log every action and state change (like `store-devtools`).
- **Hydration:** Load state from `localStorage` on startup.
- **Clear State:** Reset the entire state on logout.

**Example (Logger):**
```typescript
export function debug(reducer: ActionReducer<any>): ActionReducer<any> {
  return function(state, action) {
    console.log('state', state);
    console.log('action', action);
    return reducer(state, action);
  };
}

export const metaReducers: MetaReducer<AppState>[] = [debug];
```

### Q28: How do Runtime Checks in NgRx help during development?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

NgRx Runtime Checks help enforce immutability and serializability in your state and actions. They are configured in the `StoreModule.forRoot` method.

**Checks Available:**
- `strictStateImmutability`: Throws if state is mutated directly.
- `strictActionImmutability`: Throws if action payload is mutated.
- `strictStateSerializability`: Ensures state is serializable (no Functions/Promises).
- `strictActionSerializability`: Ensures actions are serializable.

**Configuration:**
```typescript
StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, {
  runtimeChecks: {
    strictStateImmutability: true,
    strictActionImmutability: true,
    strictStateSerializability: true,
    strictActionSerializability: true,
  },
})
```

### Q29: What is the difference between concatMap, mergeMap, switchMap, and exhaustMap in NgRx Effects?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

These RxJS flattening operators handle observable streams differently, which is crucial for Effects:

- **mergeMap:** Handles all requests in parallel. Good for deletions (delete multiple items at once). **Risk:** Race conditions if order matters.
- **concatMap:** Queues requests, executing them one by one. Order is preserved. Good for creating items where order matters. **Risk:** Can be slow if one request hangs.
- **switchMap:** Cancels the previous inner observable if a new one arrives. Good for read operations (search typeahead). **Risk:** Previous requests are cancelled.
- **exhaustMap:** Ignores new requests until the current one completes. Good for non-idempotent operations like login (ignore extra clicks).

**Usage:**
- `switchMap` for **Reads** (Load Users).
- `concatMap` for **Writes** (Update/Create) where order matters.
- `mergeMap` for **Deletes** or parallel writes.
- `exhaustMap` for **Auth/Submit** buttons.

---

### Q30: How do you handle optimistic updates in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Optimistic updates update the UI state *before* the server confirms the change, providing a snappier user experience. If the server fails, the change is rolled back.

**Steps:**
1. **Action:** Dispatch `Update` action.
2. **Reducer:** Immediately update the state in the store.
3. **Effect:** Call API.
   - **Success:** Dispatch `UpdateSuccess` (often no state change needed if data matches).
   - **Failure:** Dispatch `UpdateFailure` which reverts the state change in the reducer.

**Example Reducer:**
```typescript
on(Actions.updateItem, (state, { item }) => ({
  ...state,
  items: state.items.map(i => i.id === item.id ? item : i) // Optimistic update
})),
on(Actions.updateItemFailure, (state, { originalItem }) => ({
  ...state,
  items: state.items.map(i => i.id === originalItem.id ? originalItem : i) // Revert
}))
```

### Q31: What is NgRx Entity and what problem does it solve?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

NgRx Entity provides an API to manipulate and query entity collections. It standardizes the way you store collections of objects, reducing boilerplate.

**Problem Solved:**
- Instead of arrays, it uses a Dictionary (Map) structure (`{ ids: [], entities: {} }`) for O(1) access.
- Provides helper methods for common operations: `addOne`, `addAll`, `updateOne`, `removeOne`.

**Example:**
```typescript
export const adapter = createEntityAdapter<User>();
export const initialState = adapter.getInitialState();

export const userReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(UserActions.addUser, (state, { user }) => adapter.addOne(user, state)),
  on(UserActions.deleteUser, (state, { id }) => adapter.removeOne(id, state))
);
```

---

### Q32: How do you unit test NgRx Selectors?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Selectors are pure functions, making them the easiest part of NgRx to test. You simply call the projector function with a mock state.

**Projector Testing:**
Every selector created with `createSelector` has a `.projector` property which is the pure function itself.

**Example:**
```typescript
// selector.ts
export const selectUserCount = createSelector(
  selectUsers,
  (users) => users.length
);

// selector.spec.ts
it('should select user count', () => {
  const users = [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }];
  const result = selectUserCount.projector(users);
  expect(result).toBe(2);
});
```

---

### Q33: How do you unit test NgRx Effects using Marble Testing?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Marble testing allows you to test asynchronous RxJS streams synchronously by defining the timing of events with a string syntax.

**Key Symbols:**
- `-`: Time frame (10ms).
- `a`: Emitted value.
- `|`: Completion.
- `#`: Error.

**Example:**
```typescript
it('should return loadSuccess on success', () => {
  const action = loadUsers();
  const completion = loadUsersSuccess({ users: [] });

  actions$ = hot('-a', { a: action });
  const response = cold('-b|', { b: [] });
  userService.getUsers.and.returnValue(response);

  const expected = cold('--c', { c: completion });
  expect(effects.loadUsers$).toBeObservable(expected);
});
```

---

### Q34: What is the Router Store in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

`@ngrx/router-store` binds the Angular Router state to the NgRx Store. It allows you to dispatch router actions (time-travel debugging for routes) and select route params/data from the store.

**Benefits:**
- Route changes dispatch actions (traceable in DevTools).
- Access route params in Selectors (combine route ID with entity data).

**Example Selector:**
```typescript
export const selectSelectedUser = createSelector(
  selectUserEntities,
  selectRouteParam('id'),
  (users, id) => users[id]
);
```

---

### Q35: How do you implement a logout flow that clears the entire state?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

To clear the entire state on logout, you can use a **Metareducer**. When the `Logout` action is dispatched, the metareducer can return `undefined` (or initial state) to reset the store.

**Example:**
```typescript
export function clearState(reducer: ActionReducer<AppState>): ActionReducer<AppState> {
  return function(state, action) {
    if (action.type === '[Auth] Logout') {
      state = undefined; // Reducers will return their initial state
    }
    return reducer(state, action);
  };
}
```

### Q36: What is the difference between 'Store' and 'ComponentStore'?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

- **Global Store (`@ngrx/store`):**
  - Single source of truth for the whole app.
  - Best for shared state (User, Config, Cache).
  - Uses Actions, Reducers, Effects.
  - High boilerplate.

- **ComponentStore (`@ngrx/component-store`):**
  - Independent state for a specific component/feature.
  - Clean API (no actions/reducers, just methods).
  - Best for local component state or complex isolated features.
  - Lower boilerplate.

**Use Global Store for:** Shared data.
**Use ComponentStore for:** Complex local UI state (Pagination, Filters).

---

### Q37: How do you manage local UI state in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

For local UI state (like form open/close, tab selection) that doesn't need to be shared:

1. **Component Property:** Just use a variable in the component.
2. **ComponentStore:** If the logic is complex.
3. **Global Store:** ONLY if the state needs to persist across routes or be accessed by other features.

**Anti-pattern:** Putting *everything* (like `isDropdownOpen`) in the Global Store.

---

### Q38: Explain the concept of 'Selectors with Props'.

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Sometimes you need to select data based on a parameter (like an ID). Note that `createSelector` does not accept arguments directly at call time in the `select()` method in recent NgRx versions without a factory or props.

**Pattern:**
```typescript
export const selectUserById = (props: { id: string }) => createSelector(
  selectUserEntities,
  (entities) => entities[props.id]
);

// Usage
store.select(selectUserById({ id: '123' }));
```
*Note: This creates a new selector instance every time. For memoization with props, it's better to rely on data in the store (like `selectedId`) or use third-party libraries if needed.*

---

### Q39: How can you prevent state mutation in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

State in NgRx must be immutable.

1. **Spread Operator:** Use `...state` to copy.
2. **Runtime Checks:** Enable `strictStateImmutability` in `StoreModule`.
3. **Libraries:** Use `Immer` (via `ngrx-immer`) to write mutable-style code that produces immutable state safely.
4. **Linter:** Use `eslint-plugin-ngrx`.

---

### Q40: What is NgRx SignalStore?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

NgRx SignalStore is a new state management solution introduced to align with Angular Signals. It offers a functional, signal-based approach to state.

**Key Features:**
- **Signals Native:** Exposes state as Signals.
- **Modular:** Extensions for entities, HTTP, etc.
- **Lightweight:** No reducers/actions boilerplate.

**Example:**
```typescript
export const UserStore = signalStore(
  withState({ users: [], loading: false }),
  withMethods((store, service = inject(UserService)) => ({
    async loadUsers() {
      patchState(store, { loading: true });
      const users = await lastValueFrom(service.getUsers());
      patchState(store, { users, loading: false });
    }
  }))
);
```

### Q41: How do you handle error handling in NgRx Effects?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Errors in Effects must be caught effectively, or they will **complete** the effect stream (killing it).

**Correct Pattern:** Use `catchError` within the **inner** observable (inside `switchMap`/`mergeMap`).

**Example:**
```typescript
load$ = createEffect(() => actions$.pipe(
  ofType(load),
  switchMap(() => service.get().pipe(
    map(data => success({ data })),
    catchError(error => of(failure({ error }))) // Correct: Returns action, stream stays alive
  ))
));
```

**Incorrect Pattern:** Placing `catchError` after `switchMap` will terminate the effect on error.

---

### Q42: What are 'Feature States' and how do you lazy load them?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Feature States allow you to slice your state into chunks that correspond to feature modules.

**Lazy Loading:**
When a lazy-loaded module is initialized, `StoreModule.forFeature('featureName', reducer)` injects that slice into the global state dynamically.

**Structure:**
```
Root State
├── Layout
├── Auth
└── Products (Lazy Loaded Feature)
```

---

### Q43: What is the difference between 'Action' and 'Action Creator'?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

- **Action:** The actual object dispatched to the store. It has a `type` and optional payload.
  - `{ type: '[User] Load', id: 1 }`
- **Action Creator:** A function that returns the Action object.
  - `const loadUser = createAction('[User] Load', props<{id: number}>());`

Using creators provides type safety and reduces typo errors compared to string literals.

---

### Q44: How do you use NgRx for Form Handling?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Handling forms in Redux can be verbose (dispatching on every keystroke).

**Approaches:**
1. **Local State:** Keep form state local, dispatch only on Submit. (Recommended for simple forms).
2. **NgRx Forms:** Libraries like `ngrx-forms` bind state to forms.
3. **Update on Blur:** Dispatch actions only when fields lose focus to reduce noise.

---

### Q45: How do you debug NgRx applications?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

1. **Redux DevTools Extension:** The standard tool. Shows action log, state diffs, and allows time travel.
2. **Logging Metareducer:** Console log actions/state.
3. **RxJS Tap:** Use `tap` in Effects to log flow.
4. **Selectors:** Check if selectors are recomputing too often.

---

### Q46: What is the 'Container/Presentational' component pattern in NgRx context?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

- **Smart (Container) Components:**
  - Interact with the Store (dispatch actions, select state).
  - Pass data down via `Input`.
  - Listen to events via `Output`.
- **Dumb (Presentational) Components:**
  - Pure UI.
  - No dependency on NgRx/Store.
  - Receive data via `@Input()`.
  - Emit events via `@Output()`.

**Benefit:** Decouples UI from State Management, making UI components reusable and easier to test.

---

### Q47: How do you handle multiple dependent API calls in an Effect?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Use RxJS higher-order mapping operators (`switchMap`, `mergeMap`) nested or chained.

**Example:**
```typescript
effect$ = createEffect(() => actions$.pipe(
  ofType(loginSuccess),
  switchMap(action => 
    // Call 1
    this.profileService.getProfile(action.token).pipe(
      // Call 2 (dependent on profile)
      concatMap(profile => 
        this.settingsService.getSettings(profile.id).pipe(
          map(settings => loadDataSuccess({ profile, settings }))
        )
      )
    )
  )
));
```

---

### Q48: What is 'Action Hygiene'?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Action Hygiene refers to writing good, descriptive actions.

**Best Practices:**
- **Source-Event-Command:** `[Source] Event` vs `[Source] Command`.
- **Unique Types:** Ensure types are unique.
- **Don't Reuse Actions:** Avoid generic actions like `setData`. Use `[User] Load Success` and `[Product] Load Success` separately.
- **Describe Event, Not Setter:** Use `[Page] User Clicked Submit` instead of `[Store] Set Loading True`. Let the reducer decide what that means (setting loading true).

---

### Q49: How to implement undo/redo functionality with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

You can implement a higher-order reducer (metareducer) that keeps a history of past states.

**Logic:**
1. Maintain `past`, `present`, `future` arrays in the wrapper state.
2. On `UNDO` action: Move `present` to `future`, pop from `past` to `present`.
3. On `REDO` action: Move `present` to `past`, pop from `future` to `present`.
4. On other actions: Push `present` to `past`, clear `future`, update `present`.

---

### Q50: What is the difference between `createSelector` and `store.select`?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

- **`createSelector`:** A utility to define a memoized selector function. It combines other selectors. It does NOT access the store directly.
- **`store.select`:** An Observable operator or method that takes a selector (or path) and emits the slice of state from the Store stream.

**Analogy:** `createSelector` is the SQL Query definition. `store.select` is executing that query against the database.

---

### Q51: How do you handle file uploads in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

1. **Action:** `uploadFile({ file: File })`.
2. **Effect:** Listens to action, calls Service with `FormData`.
3. **Progress:** Service can report progress events. Effect can dispatch `uploadProgress({ progress })` actions.
4. **Reducer:** Updates `uploadProgress` state for UI bar.

*Note: Dispatching many progress actions (e.g., 100 for 1-100%) can cause performance issues. Consider throttling.*

---

### Q52: Can you use NgRx with React or other frameworks?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

NgRx is specifically built for Angular (relying on RxJS and Angular's DI).
- **React:** Uses Redux, MobX, Zustand, or Context.
- **Vue:** Uses Vuex or Pinia.

However, the *concepts* (Redux pattern, RxJS) are universal. There is a library `ngrx-w` (rare) but generally, NgRx is Angular-exclusive.

---

### Q53: What is `ngrx-data`?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

`@ngrx/data` is a library built on top of Store/Effects/Entity that automates the creation of actions, reducers, effects, and dispatchers for standard REST entities.

**Benefit:** Zero boilerplate for standard CRUD. You just define the Entity Metadata and the API endpoint pattern.

---

### Q54: How do you persist NgRx state to LocalStorage?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Use a **Metareducer** that:
1. On INIT/UPDATE: Merges state from LocalStorage into the initial state.
2. On any action: Saves the new state (or slice of state) to LocalStorage.

*Libraries like `ngrx-store-localstorage` simplify this.*

---

### Q55: What is the role of `EffectsModule.forRoot()` vs `forFeature()`?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

- **`forRoot([])`:** Registers the `EffectsModule` provider and runs root effects. Must be called once in `AppModule`.
- **`forFeature([Effect])`:** Registers feature-specific effects. Used in Feature Modules. These effects start running when the module is loaded.

---

### Q56: How to handle WebSocket data streams in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

1. **Effect:** Connects to WebSocket.
2. **Stream:** The Effect listens to the WS Observable.
3. **Dispatch:** For every incoming WS message, the Effect maps it to an Action (e.g., `socketMessageReceived`).
4. **Cleanup:** Ensure the Effect closes the WS connection on destroy or logout.

---

### Q57: Why is `OnPush` change detection recommended with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

NgRx promotes immutability. When state changes, the object reference changes.
`ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` relies on reference checks (`prev !== curr`) to decide whether to re-render.
Using NgRx + `async` pipe + OnPush results in highly performant apps that only re-render strictly when data changes.

---

### Q58: What is the difference between Imperative and Reactive state management?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

- **Imperative:** calling methods to change state (`service.users = [...]`). Harder to trace.
- **Reactive (NgRx):** Dispatching events (`loadUsers`). The system reacts. The sender doesn't know *who* handles it or *how*. Easier to decouple and scale.

---

### Q59: How do you mock the Store in Unit Tests?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Use `provideMockStore` from `@ngrx/store/testing`.

```typescript
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    provideMockStore({ 
      initialState: { users: [] },
      selectors: [
        { selector: selectAllUsers, value: [{id: 1}] }
      ]
    })
  ]
});
```

---

### Q60: What is the 'Smart' vs 'Dumb' component pattern?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

(Duplicate concept of Container/Presentational).
- **Smart:** Knows about the Store.
- **Dumb:** Only knows `@Input` and `@Output`.

---

### Q61: How do you handle Race Conditions in Effects?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

RxJS operators solve this:
- **switchMap:** Cancels old request. Solves "search typeahead" race (only want latest).
- **concatMap:** Queues requests. Solves "save order" race (save A then save B).

---

### Q62: What is the difference between `props` and payload in Actions?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

- Old NgRx (Pre-8): Classes with a `payload` property.
- Modern NgRx: `createAction` uses `props<{ ... }>()`.

They are effectively the same (data carrier), but `props` is the modern, functional API way.

---

### Q63: How to handle complex derived state?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Use **Selectors**. Selectors can compose other selectors.
If you need `ActiveUsers` (derived from `Users` and `Filter`), create a selector that takes both.
This keeps the Reducer simple (normalized data) and puts logic in Selectors (view data).

---

### Q64: What is normalization in State Management?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Normalization means storing data like a database:
- No duplicates.
- References by ID.
- Flattened structure (no deep nesting).

**Example:**
Instead of `[{ id: 1, name: 'A', posts: [{id: 10}] }]`,
Store: `users: { 1: {id: 1, posts: [10]} }`, `posts: { 10: {...} }`.

---

### Q65: How do you use `ngrx-schematics`?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

NgRx Schematics allow generating boilerplate via CLI.
`ng generate @ngrx/schematics:store State --root --module app.module.ts`
`ng generate @ngrx/schematics:feature Feature --module feature.module.ts`

---

### Q66: What is the `createFeature` function?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Introduced in recent NgRx versions to reduce boilerplate.
It automatically generates selectors for the feature state properties.

```typescript
const userFeature = createFeature({
  name: 'user',
  reducer: userReducer
});
// Automatically gives: userFeature.selectUsers, userFeature.selectLoading
```

---

### Q67: How do you handle authentication token refresh with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

In an Interceptor or Effect:
1. Catch 401 error.
2. Dispatch `RefreshToken` action.
3. Effect calls refresh API.
   - Success: Dispatch `RefreshTokenSuccess` (updates token), retry original request.
   - Failure: Dispatch `Logout`.

---

### Q68: What are the downsides of NgRx?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

- **Boilerplate:** Lots of files (Actions, Reducers, Effects, Selectors).
- **Complexity:** Steep learning curve (RxJS knowledge required).
- **Indirection:** Harder to follow flow ("Where did this change come from?").

---

### Q69: When should you NOT use NgRx?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

- Small, simple applications.
- Apps with little shared state.
- When team is not comfortable with RxJS.
- Static content sites.

---

### Q70: How do you access the Store in a Service?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

You can inject `Store` into a Service just like a Component.
However, Services are usually consumed *by* Effects.
If a Service needs state, pass it as an argument from the Effect/Component, rather than injecting Store into the Service (avoids circular deps and tight coupling).

---

### Q71: What is `router-store` serialization?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

By default, Angular Router state is complex and not serializable.
`@ngrx/router-store` allows providing a `RouterStateSerializer` to distill the router state into just what you need (url, params, queryParams) for the Redux DevTools.

---

### Q72: How do you test a Reducer?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

Reducers are pure functions.
1. Define `initialState`.
2. Call reducer with `initialState` and an `Action`.
3. Assert the return value matches expected new state.

```typescript
const result = reducer(initialState, action);
expect(result.loading).toBe(true);
```

---

### Q73: What is the `StoreDevtoolsModule` 'maxAge' option?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

`maxAge` limits the number of actions kept in history (e.g., 25). This saves memory and performance in the DevTools. Old actions fall off the history.

---

### Q74: How do you handle loading spinners with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

1. State has `loading: boolean`.
2. Action `Load`: Reducer sets `loading = true`.
3. Action `Success/Fail`: Reducer sets `loading = false`.
4. Component selects `selectLoading` and passes to `*ngIf` or `<spinner>`.

---

### Q75: What is the difference between `dispatch` and `next`?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

- `store.dispatch(action)`: Sends an action to the NgRx Store.
- `subject.next(value)`: Emits a value in a standard RxJS Subject.

---

### Q76: How do you combine multiple selectors?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

```typescript
export const selectViewModel = createSelector(
  selectUser,
  selectCart,
  (user, cart) => ({ user, cart })
);
```
This is useful to provide a single Observable to the component template (`vm$ | async`).

---

### Q77: What is 'State Hydration'?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Hydration is the process of restoring state from storage (localStorage, server) into the memory (Store) on application startup.
Usually handled by a Metareducer that checks storage on `INIT`.

---

### Q78: How do you secure specific actions?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Actions are just messages. Security should be enforced at:
1. **Guards:** Prevent navigating to the page that dispatches the action.
2. **Effects/Service:** The API call will fail (403) if unauthorized.
3. **Reducer:** You could check role in reducer, but logic usually belongs in Effects/Backend.

---

### Q79: What is the `ofType` operator?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

`ofType` is an NgRx operator used in Effects to filter the stream of all actions down to just the specific action types you care about.
`actions$.pipe(ofType(UserActions.load))`

---

### Q80: How do you implement Pagination with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

State: `{ items: [], page: 1, total: 100 }`.
Action: `loadPage({ page: 2 })`.
Effect: Triggers API call with `?page=2`.
Selector: `selectCurrentPageItems` (if caching all) or just `selectItems`.

---

### Q81: What is 'Optimistic Concurrency Control'?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Handling conflicts when multiple users edit data.
In NgRx:
1. Send `version` or `timestamp` with update action.
2. Backend checks version.
3. If conflict (409), Effect dispatches `UpdateConflict` action.
4. UI prompts user to reload or overwrite.

---

### Q82: How do you use `ngrx-let` directive?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

`*ngrxLet` (from `@ngrx/component`) is a better `*ngIf` + `async`.
- Handles falsy values (0, false) correctly (unlike `*ngIf` which hides them).
- Binds to a context variable.

```html
<div *ngrxLet="users$ as users">
  {{ users.length }}
</div>
```

---

### Q83: What is `ngrx-push` pipe?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

`ngrxPush` is a replacement for the `async` pipe.
- Works in zoneless applications (doesn't rely on Zone.js).
- More performant change detection scheduling.

---

### Q84: How to handle 'Cancel' actions in Effects?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Use `takeUntil` operator in the effect pipe.

```typescript
load$ = createEffect(() => actions$.pipe(
  ofType(load),
  switchMap(() => service.get().pipe(
    takeUntil(actions$.pipe(ofType(cancelLoad)))
  ))
));
```

---

### Q85: What is the `OnInitEffects` interface?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

An interface that Effects classes can implement. It forces a `ngrxOnInitEffects` method which returns an Action. This action is dispatched immediately when the Effect class is registered.
Useful for pre-loading data without Component dispatch.

---

### Q86: How do you store Date objects in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

It is best practice to store Dates as **strings (ISO format)** or **numbers (timestamp)** in the Store to ensure serializability.
Convert to `Date` object in the Selector or Pipe for display.

---

### Q87: How do you handle 'Global Error Handling' with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Create a shared `Errors` feature state.
All Effects catch errors and dispatch a `GlobalError({ message })` action.
The Error Reducer adds it to state.
The App Component listens to `selectLastError` and shows a Toast/Snackbar.

---

### Q88: What is `createActionGroup`?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

New in NgRx 14+. Reduces boilerplate for defining multiple related actions.

```typescript
export const UserActions = createActionGroup({
  source: 'User API',
  events: {
    'Load Users': emptyProps(),
    'Load Users Success': props<{ users: User[] }>(),
    'Load Users Failure': props<{ error: string }>(),
  }
});
```

---

### Q89: How do you reset a specific feature state?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Handle a `Reset` action in the feature reducer that returns `initialState`.

```typescript
on(resetAction, () => initialState)
```

---

### Q90: Can Effects dispatch multiple actions?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Yes.
1. Return an array of actions (with `switchMap` returning `from([act1, act2])`).
2. Or dispatch one action that triggers other effects.

---

### Q91: What is the difference between `Effect` (decorator) and `createEffect`?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

- `@Effect()`: Old, deprecated syntax (Class property decorator).
- `createEffect()`: Modern syntax. Better type safety and no decorator metadata issues.

---

### Q92: How to use NgRx with Standalone Components?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Bootstrap the store in `app.config.ts` (or `main.ts`):

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideStore(reducers),
    provideEffects([AppEffects]),
    provideStoreDevtools()
  ]
});
```

---

### Q93: How do you handle partial updates (Patch)?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Action: `updateUser({ update: Partial<User> })`.
Reducer: `...state, user: { ...state.user, ...update }`.

---

### Q94: What is a 'Functional Effect'?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

Functional Effects (NgRx 15+) allow writing effects as pure functions without Classes/Injectable.

```typescript
export const loadUsers = createEffect(
  (actions$ = inject(Actions), service = inject(UserService)) => 
    actions$.pipe(...)
, { functional: true });
```

---

### Q95: How do you test Observables in NgRx without Marbles?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Use `subscribe` and `done` callback (Jasmine/Jest).

```typescript
it('should get data', (done) => {
  store.select(selectData).subscribe(data => {
    expect(data).toBeTruthy();
    done();
  });
});
```

---

### Q96: What is the Repository Pattern with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Repository Pattern usually replaces the Service layer.
Effect -> Repository -> API.
The Repository abstracts the data source (API vs LocalStorage vs Cache).

---

### Q97: How do you handle deep cloning in Reducers?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Manual spread `...` is shallow.
For deep updates:
1. `...state, nested: { ...state.nested, prop: 1 }` (Manual nesting).
2. `immer`: Allows `state.nested.prop = 1` mutation syntax that compiles to immutable update.

---

### Q98: What is 'Duck Pattern' or 'Redux Ducks'?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**

A file structure pattern where Actions, Reducers, and Selectors for a feature are bundled in a single file (often `feature.ts` or `ducks/feature.ts`) instead of separate files.
NgRx usually prefers separate files, but Ducks is valid for small features.

---

### Q99: How do you deal with large initial state?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**

If `initialState` is huge, app startup slows.
Solution:
- Lazy load feature states.
- Initialize with `null` and load data asynchronously.

---

### Q100: What is `selectSignal`?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**

Method to get a Signal from the store instead of an Observable.
`const user = store.selectSignal(selectUser);`
Useful for using state in template without `async` pipe (Angular 17+).

---

### Q101: How to implement 'User Typing' feature with NgRx?

Dispatch 'Refresh' action. Effect calls API. Reducer clears old data and sets loading.

---

### Q103: How to implement 'Infinite Scroll' with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**
Dispatch 'LoadMore' action. Effect calls API with offset/page. Reducer appends new items to existing array.

---

### Q104: How to handle multiple environments in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**
Use `environment.ts` to configure `StoreDevtools` (logOnly in prod) or API URLs in Effects.

---

### Q105: What is the role of `reducerFactory`?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Internal function that combines reducers. Can be overridden to provide custom root meta-reducer logic.

---

### Q106: How to debug 'Actions not triggering Reducer'?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**
Standalone API to register effects without NgModules.

---

### Q110: How to share state between Angular Elements (Web Components)?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Store must be in the host or shared via a global window object/service, as Elements have isolated injectors.

---

### Q111: How to handle cross-tab communication with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Listen to `storage` event in a Metareducer or Effect to sync state changes from other tabs.

---

### Q112: What is `ngrx-store-freeze`?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**
Old library to prevent state mutation. Replaced by built-in Runtime Checks.

---

### Q113: How to handle Form Array with NgRx?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

Store data as array. Component builds FormArray from selector. Updates dispatch actions with index.

---

### Q114: How to implement Undo for specific feature only?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Implement undo logic in that feature's reducer (keeping past/future arrays for that feature only).

---

### Q115: How to use NgRx with GraphQL?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**
Effects call Apollo Client methods instead of HTTP Client. Actions map to Query/Mutation results.

---

### Q116: What is the `On` function signature?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**
`on(ActionCreator, (state, props) => newState)`.

---

### Q117: How to testing Effects that use `combineLatest`?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Mock multiple source observables in the test setup.

---

### Q118: What is the difference between `store.dispatch` and `effect`?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**
Dispatch triggers the process. Effect handles the side-effect (process) and dispatches result.

---

### Q119: How to optimize large lists in NgRx?

**Difficulty: Performance**

**Answer:**
Use `@ngrx/entity`. Use `trackBy` in template. Use Virtual Scroll.

---

### Q120: How to handle 'Session Timeout'?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Action dispatched automatically by NgRx when root effects are initialized. Hook for startup logic.

---

### Q122: What is `UPDATE` action in Entity?

**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**
Action created by `adapter.updateOne`. Updates specific fields of an entity.

---

### Q123: How to implement 'Select All' functionality?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**
Action `SelectAll`. Reducer sets `selected: true` for all items (or adds all IDs to set).

---

### Q124: How to handle 'Network Offline'?

**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Listen to `window:offline`. Dispatch `AppOffline`. Reducer updates UI state.

---

### Q125: What is the benefit of 'Selectors' over 'Getters'?

**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**
Selectors are memoized (cached). Getters re-run every change detection cycle.

---
