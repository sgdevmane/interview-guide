### Q18: What is the App Router?
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**
The new routing paradigm introduced in Next.js 13 (stable in 13.4).
*   **Structure:** Uses a folder-based hierarchy inside an `app/` directory.
*   **Features:** Built-in support for React Server Components, nested layouts, loading states, error handling, and streaming.
*   **Files:** `page.js`, `layout.js`, `template.js`, `loading.js`, `error.js`, `not-found.js`.

### Q19: Server Components vs Client Components.
**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
*   **Server Components (Default in App Router):**
    *   Render on the server.
    *   Can directly access database/fs.
    *   Zero bundle size (code not sent to client).
    *   Cannot use hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) or event listeners.
*   **Client Components:**
    *   Render on client (and pre-rendered on server).
    *   Marked with `'use client'` directive.
    *   Can use hooks and interactivity.
    *   Hydrated on the browser.

### Q20: How to fetch data in App Router?
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**
You can use standard `fetch` directly in Server Components.
```javascript
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  return <main>{data.title}</main>;
}
```
`fetch` is extended by Next.js to support caching and revalidation.

*   Great for SEO and performance.
*   *Note:* In App Router, replaced by simple async components or `generateStaticParams`.

### Q23: What is `getServerSideProps`?
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

**Answer:**
(Pages Router) A function used to fetch data on **every request**.
*   Used for Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
*   Slower than SSG (TTFB depends on data fetch).
*   Good for highly dynamic data that changes constantly.
*   *Note:* In App Router, replaced by `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` or `no-store` fetch.

### Q24: What is ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)?
**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Allows you to create or update static pages *after* you’ve built your site.
*   You can retain the benefits of static generation (performance) while scaling to millions of pages.
*   **Mechanism:** Define a `revalidate` time (in seconds).
*   Next.js will serve the old page, then regenerate it in the background for the next visitor.

### Q25: Dynamic Routes in Next.js.
**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**
Routes that support dynamic parameters.
*   **Syntax:** File name wrapped in brackets, e.g., `pages/posts/[id].js` or `app/posts/[id]/page.js`.

*   On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render.
*   Can be nested.
*   **Root Layout:** Required in `app/`, defines `<html>` and `<body>`.

### Q28: What is `template.js`?
**Difficulty: Advanced**

**Answer:**
Similar to a Layout, but creates a **new instance** for each of its children on navigation.
*   State is reset.
*   Effects are re-executed.
*   Useful for features that rely on `useEffect` (e.g., page view tracking) or animation libraries (Framer Motion) that need to see a new component mount.

### Q29: How to handle 404 errors?
**Difficulty: Beginner**

**Answer:**
*   **Pages Router:** Create `pages/404.js`.
